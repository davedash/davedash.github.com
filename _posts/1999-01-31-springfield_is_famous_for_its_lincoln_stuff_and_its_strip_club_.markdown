title: Springfield is famous for its Lincoln stuff and its strip club.
excerpt: |-
  
  I want to video myself sleeping.  If I get the camera working I will.  Because, I see jack 
  
  tossing and turning and I wonder if I do that.  I imagine I do.  I wish I could sleep 
  
  perfectly facing straight up with a smile on my face.  Well no, not a smile.  If I was 
  
  smiling, Molly would somehow find a way to get a picture of me.
  
  <p>A lot of second generation Indians are really stuck up snobs.  Like they aren't nice in 
  
  the least.  On the other hand others are really nice, sometimes too nice.  There's no real 
  
  correlation of why some are nice and some aren't.  So anyway, to all you Indian snobs, "I 
  
  hope you die and go to hell."
  
  <p>Anand down the hall is working on a car MP3 player.  It's going to be superb.  I get to 
  
  help him with some of the Linux and programming.  Right now we have a motherboard witha  
  
  Cyrix MII and everything is integrated on the board, which makes it very easy, it'll be 
  
  really slim.
  
  <p>College has humbled me.  I used to think that I wanted to have lots of money, but that's 
  
  not exactly the case.  I just want power now.  I want enough stuff that makes me content.  I 
  
  want the ability to do any of my interests.  None of these things require that much money.  
  
  I also want power though.
  <p> I woke when Molly slept, but then I fell asleep for an hour/hour-and-a-half.  I miss 
  
  Molly.  I could so kick her ass at Dr. Mario.
  
  <p>I'm watching <i>Hackers</i>.  I love it.  They are playing Orbital's <i>Halcyon and on and on</i>.  That's such a beautiful song.  All the other music has me wishing it was on MP3 or CD... time to go search.  This is on the wishlist now.  Wait, wow... this movie sucks.
