title: advice or help
excerpt: |-
  I used to feel upset when people didn't take good advice or help from me for whatever reason.  Actually in a more general sense if people didn't believe me.  Maybe I just thought that it was a waste of knowledge.  I could give an example, but I think you know what I'm talking about.  Now I don't care.  If people don't believe me, I could care less.  It really doesn't directly effect me.  Plus it boils down to this.  When people don't take your advice and you are right, you can always tell them, "I told you so."
  <P>"We never should have let the Robot army use Unit One as one of their military installations.  What were we thinking, not listening to Dave Dash."
