I do a lot of [YUI grid layouts](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/) and I love the nestable grids:

	<div class="yui-g$1"> 
		<div class="yui-u first">
			$2
		</div>
		<div class="yui-u">
			$3
		</div>
	</div>

There's a tab stop after `yui-g` in case you want to use one of the variants (`yui-gb`, `yui-gc`, etc).

I'm working on a site that uses two equal width columns... a lot... so this comes in quite handy.  So long tables.
