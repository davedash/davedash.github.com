title: Davenport, IA
excerpt: |-
  Hey everybody, second day of being on the road.  Yesterday we stayed in a Hilton in Sioux City, IA.  I had trouble getting online there.  I went to a few hospitals with my brother and went to a luncheon.  (For those of you who don't know, my brother is a sales rep. for a pharmecutical company.)
  <P>
  After that we made way to Davenport.  We checked into a Radisson hotel.  It's very nice with a view of the river.  MSN works well in this town too so I checked my mail and read that Allen Hall has updated it's routers to 10/100 base T system (i.e. fast internet).
  <P>
  I should be at Allen Hall soon.  For those of you at home, I miss you guys.  For those of you coming back to school, I'm looking forward to see you guys.
  <P>Email me.
