title: Labor Day Weekend
excerpt: |-
  My parents came on Sunday and I stayed at the Holiday Inn which is better than my dorm.  It was nice, they came bringing many gifts (birthday).  They left yesterday.<p>
  My brother sent with them a cool mat and a nice window fan.  I'm happy.<p>Today I enrolled for the "They Might Be Giants" lottery.  Basically I can buy my ticket sometime early on Thursday.  It's wierd.  I saw them last month...  I want to find somebody to go with me, but I don't know people who like They Might Be Giants on campus.  I may just do a solo thing.  That'd be neat.  By the way, the song that's been in my head this week is <a href="http://www.lyrics.ch/query/get?s=86604">Ana Ng</a>.<p>Oh yeah, today is the day that I decided to update my "friends" page.  If you have a web page and it's not listed in the friends page, then send an email or ICQ me and I'll add it.
