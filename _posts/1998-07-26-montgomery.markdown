title: Montgomery
excerpt: Well Dan Lavenda, Molly, Katie, Zach Wyman and I went to Montgomery which is south of Shakopee.  It was pretty fun.  We did a lot of walking around.  There's not much in that town really.  I didn't like the Kolacky's that much.  To me they were just dinner rolls with jam inside them.  I guess the rest of the group got something out of them that I didn't.<p>We also went to Northfield and walked around on St. Olaf's campus.  That place is very churchish.  I'm glad I don't go there.  I pulled a Gandhi, because I had only $2.  I ate when I got home, but never stopped being hungry.  I should probably eat breakfast soon.<p>Today I organized more of my room.  It is now easier to find stuff.

Today I organized more of my room.  It is now easier to find stuff.
