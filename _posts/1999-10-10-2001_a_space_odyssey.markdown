title: "2001: A Space Odyssey"
excerpt: |-
  "I am a HAL nine thousand computer Production Number 3. I became operational at the Hal Plant in Urbana, Illinois, on January 12, 1997."  That made the movie enjoyable.  That, and HAL singing Daisy.
  <P>
  If you saw the Simpson's episode that parodied this movie, you'd get the gist of the movie.  It was a very strange 2:20 minute movie with only :40 of talking.  The other 1:40 was dead silence or various pieces of music which most people would immediately recognize.  Artsy-Kubric stuff.
  <P>I won't go as far to say this was a bad movie.  In fact, I think everyone should see this movie once.  I'm going to read the book, and try to understand what Stanley Kubric was trying to portray.
