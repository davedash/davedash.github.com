  I have a problem with <a href="http://cnn.com/US/9811/11/jacksonville.murder.ap/">this article</a>.  Read through it.  Look at the last two paragraphs.  The problem I have is that those last two paragraphs don't flow at all with the article.  I think the press should stick to more fact-based information rather than this human side stuff.  My sympathy for the victim and the victim's family has been lowered because of the weak conclusion to the article.
  <p>I finished my <a href="http://www.ftmax.com/981112-ventura.html">Ventura article</a>.  It's not as organized and documented as I would have liked, but under my current time constraints, it is the best I could do.  I've got two nice and long research papers to write by the end of the quarter (which is coming very fast).
  <p>Check out this week's poll at <a href="http://www.popsci.com/">PopSci.com</a>.  I like what the results show.
  <p>Wow... I'm full and it's after midnight.  I went to eat at <a href="http://www.urh/dining/srs/Dons.html">Fat Don's</a>.  That's the first time I've eaten so much.  Depending on what they serve, I'll go there as a weekly thing.
  <p>My friends are missing tonight... hmm where could they be?
