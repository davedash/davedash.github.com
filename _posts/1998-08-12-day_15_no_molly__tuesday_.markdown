title: Day 15 No Molly (Tuesday)
excerpt: Today I lured Anna into my house.  I advised her on a computer and she's ordered it tonight.  Marc, Anna and I went grocery shopping and we got a lot of macaroni and cheese type food... I am borrowing two more of the dune books, and hope to finish them soon.  I have also been working on the Hindu Mandir email database (again) and studying the Japanese language for my test on the 20th.  I configured a machine for under $3000.  It could be called a dream machine I guess.  450 MHz 256MB of RAM... it's in almost every way better than my current computer.  This is something that would be hard to beat even if I ordered it from Micron Recondition... of course those once in a while machines like the one I have come along...
