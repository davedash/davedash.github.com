title: Chocolate Cake... what a novel idea.. at 2 in the morning.
excerpt: |-
  Dan, Katie and I (out of an initial group of six) thought it was worthwhile to go get some chocolate cake tonight.  Well we settled for some little debbies and chocolate chip cookies (the latter which we did not eat).
  <P>I washed it down with some good cream soda... nothing better than going to sleep with a lot of sugar in the system.  Ah 'munchies' at 2 AM... how collegiate.
