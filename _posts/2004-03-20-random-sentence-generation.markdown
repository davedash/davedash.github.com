The Random Sentence Generator is really easy to write, but I keep running into problems with English.  So each time I run into something (e.g. "a" and "an" can only precede certain words) I write a new piece of code to handle it.

I'm accepting madlib suggestions for sentences and if you have some word lists, sure I'll take those.

Nada should be proud.
