excerpt: |-
  Today we (me, my friends, my cousin, my brother and sis-in-law) went to see Shakesphere in the Park's performance of the <i>Tempest</i> at Highland Park in <B>St. Paul</B>.  It was well done.  My brother made very good food and we also had the <A HREF='/journal.php3?view=093210304549'>aforementioned brownies</A>.
  <P>Tonight at my house devolved into complete silliness, but others called it scandalous.  It's amazing what silly-fun can be had with sleeping bags.
  <P>I wish I was still a child.  Of course, the other day I said I wished I was a rocker.
