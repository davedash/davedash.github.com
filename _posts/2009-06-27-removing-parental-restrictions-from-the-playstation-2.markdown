title: Removing parental restrictions from the PlayStation 2

Every time I put in a DVD (House, Bones, almost anything) I'd get the parental control screen that I'd have to temporarily unlock.  While entering 0000 wasn't that difficult, it was annoying to have to do this before I could get through all the FBI warnings and to the DVD menu... and finally to my content.

Unfortunately it's hard to figure this out and the instructions are buried in the manual.  It's like this:

1. Play a DVD
2. Stop the DVD
3. Enter select to get to the custom menu.
4. Enter X on the briefcase icon.
5. Select the "lock" by moving right.
6. Go down to the parental settings and set the level to 'OFF'

It's more complicated than any game cheat I've had to do.
