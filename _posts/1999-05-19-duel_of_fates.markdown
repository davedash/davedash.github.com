title: Duel of Fates
excerpt: |
  I am deeply sorry if you have not yet seen the movie. I will not spoil it for you there are several other resources for that. I will tell you a few things. It was worth the four hours in line to get the best sounding seats at the Lorraine Theatre for the 12:01AM showing of Star Wars, the Phantom Menace. I now understand why I like <i>Duel of Fates</i> (the song) a lot. If you want to know more about what I thought, drop me a line. 
  <P>I'd post more, but it's getting late, and there's so much I could talk about regarding the movie that it would make you sick.
