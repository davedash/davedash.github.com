  <p>Mmm.. Pokey sticks.  If anybody knows of a good pokey-stick like recipe, I'm all ears.  I had them last night.  
  
  <P>Everybody loves my contact paper that's on my door, including the cool janitor.  I should take a picture of the door sometime.  I'll just wait until I get the NetCam.
  
  <P>The had a little kid (someone's son), Johnny, on <a href="http://www.kqrs.com/">KQ</a> this morning.  They were interviewing a coach of some team and the kid asked all these questions, like if the coach still smokes, if the team curses, fights, etc.  It was pretty cute.  Of course those Carl Sagan type kids do get annoying after a hundred or so "Why?"s.
  
  <p>Ah... my <a href="http://www.jvc-america.com/mini_systems/mx_d602t.html">52 lbs. package</a> has arrived.  It sounds really awesome.  So now I have a total of seven speakers dedicated to the audio I want to hear (5 speaker stereo + 2 speakers for computer).
  
  <p>It's amazing what you find out in my halls.  I found out about a Diwali function presented by the Indian Studen Association.  My friend Anand had a few extra tickets so he let me tag along.  It was very good.  It was meant for a smaller ammount of people than most functions I attend.  They performed in the Illini Room of the <a href="http://www.union.uiuc.edu">Illini Union</a>.  We were sitting at a table with this one annoying lady who complained about the music they used for some dances.  It's almost worse than people who talk during a movie.  The food was mediocre, but compared to <a href="http://www.urh.uiuc.edu/dining/DS_index.html">residence hall food</a>, excellent.  The performance was great.  They had this cool backdrop with these eyes that would stare at you.  I think they used a black light to make it glow.  The dances were great too.  What really made it an awesome function was the sound.  The sound was crisp and clear.  The only problems were those inheirent with some Indian singing, such as singers who attain high pitched notes.  The event also had a lot of comedy sketches by the emcees.  It was mostly second generations which was nice, because second generation people know how to put together an appealing event.  I think Molly, Adam, Katie, Tom, Nick and anybody else who's been to an Indian event with me would have loved it.
