title: The governor...
excerpt: |-
  I just went outside to see this chopper that was flying down.  Actually a pair of choppers.
  
  It turns out it was the Governor of Illinois and this envoy of police cars and fire trucks.  He's dedicating a crisis center.
  
  It felt like the campus was being taken over.  I mean the Beckman is the ideal place to land.  I shook hands with the governor and his wife.  Only took a few photos of the chopper, not the governor.  Oh well...
  <P>I want a copter when I grow up.  I'd fly wherever.
