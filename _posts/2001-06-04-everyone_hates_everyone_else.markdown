title: everyone hates everyone else
excerpt: |-
  So, I decided I'd look at the message oards at yahoo.com.  What a bunch of crap.  I've decided that everybody wants to pick apart (in a destructive sense) everyone elses ideas, creeds, religions, beliefs, and interpret things for each other.  So out with those message boards.  If I want to discuss religion, I've got friends with whom to discuss religion.  If I need spiritual guidance, I've got God.
  <p>
  Suzy and Adam stopped by this Friday.  That was a pleasant and enjoyable encounter.  I hope to run into others this summer too.
