title: Baby Dave...
excerpt: |-
  Actually I went to a grad party of a close family friend, Leena, and there was a picture of Leena, someone else, and I in strollers when we were wee-little babies.  Very amusing.
  <p>I also got to see a lot of cool people that I haven't seen in a while, like Sunita.  I hate seeing people who I haven't seen in a long time for only an hour or so and then not seeing them for a long time.  I wish I could teleport.
  
  <P>Tonight I came back and got a surprise call from <A HREF='http://uiuc.edu/~grinham/'>Caroline</A>.  This was pleasant.  I explained to her the simplicity of cooking Macaroni and Cheese, as I cooked up some of Annie's pasta.
  
  <P>Then Katie and Dan came over and we watch <em>Kolyo</em>.  A cute movie that takes place in Chekoslovakia before it quit the whole Communism shindig.  A very intriguing film.
  <P>I find that I can actually stand to watch foreign movies if I am in a small group of people.  Anything more than three or four and then I can't focus.
