title: It all happened "just so fast"
excerpt: |
  Sorry Su, I'm going to use that phrase always.
  <p>Well I've actually gone out and done stuff.  Let's talk about yesterday.  Yesterday was New Year's Eve.  As promised I was at the <a href="http://www.borchert.com/">Borchert's</a>.  It was nice to attend.  I saw a lot of people I hadn't seen for a while.  I even talked with my alter ego.  I even talked to Hayley.  So much was done in one night.  It was good to know that Mike Borchert and Tom Borchert among others are very into techno/electronic/wierd music like Daft Punk and Crystal Method. I loose uniqueness points, but oh well.  Molly and I attempted sleeping around three or four in the morning, unsuccessfully because of all the people.  At about 5:30 or 6:00 AM  we went to Perkins (which Tina may find amusing).  We had an amusing time.  Ryan Hayle with some help won a Budweiser racing shirt and an elf in the claw game that they have.  We had way too much fun because of the minimal sleep.  
  We left a short time after the police came.  That's right, the police came to Perkins to pick up some guy who passed out in a booth.  They had a stretcher and an ambulence and everything.  You've got to love the stupid things people do during New Years.
  <p>After Perkins I attempted to sleep again and eventually got my wish.  In the meantime the elf was tortured.  I woke up around 10 or 10:30 and started reading dilbert and ate some very delicious things that were hot... Cinnamon Buns.  Pat Borchert was kind enough to make these in the morning (once at 7 and later at 11).  Molly, Laureen, EP, Ryan and I went to see <i>a Bug's Life</i> at Shelard Park.  I finally returned home at around 2:30.
  <p>Molly picked me up and I went over to her place for dinner at about 5:30 PM.  It was nice having another meal.  At about 8:30 we left for the airport and finally a bit before 10:00 I had to let go of her (physically) and she stepped on the plane to LAX.  I shall miss her.  I shall also miss Tom, who was on the same flight, but not nearly as much.
  <p>I feel like I should be going back to UI soon.  Not that I am prepared to go.  I've very little going on in my life until January 18th.  Also, there is a correction to make.  I was so pessimistic that I thought I'd see nobody especially not dear Molly over spring break, but alas a few days of overlap do exist.  My break is from March 13 through March 21.  More details will be spilled as I get them.
