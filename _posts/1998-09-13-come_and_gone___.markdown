title: Come and gone...
excerpt: |-
  This Thursday I had the pleasure of having Dan, <a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~chirho/">Amy</a> and Molly stop by for the rest of the week.  We had a great time.  We mostly hung out.  Yesterday we went to Chicago to hang out with my friend <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~smohanty/">Sunita</a>, visit the <a href="http://www.sears-tower.com/">Sears Tower</a> and eat pizza at <a href="http://www.loumalnatis.com/">Lou Malnati's</a>.<p>They left.  I think I will miss them, because despite the heat level in my room, they added something here that was nice.  However, right now I don't feel that loss.  I believe I am still in the same mode of not feeling loss, becuase it is interfering.  I think if I had nothing to do today I would feel very sad.  I however have lots to do, I have to clean this mess-of-a-room for one thing.  I have an assortment of documents to organize.  I have several homework assignments to begin or at least preview.  By keeping myself busy I don't feel lonely.  Except now I have two bottles of Frapaccino's that Molly was supposed to take with her that will linger there for a while.  Perhaps late at night when it gets hot I will try to finish them.<p>
  My brother and sister-in-law bought a <a href="http://www.saab.com/">Saab</a> recently.  Dan Lavenda and I can hardly wait to see it.  My brother is going to make an effort to visit me either this month or next, which will be nice.  Well I am off to cleaning my room.<p>
  Which reminds me I got a few gifts for my brithday.  My mom and dad bought me a real nice Columbia Jacket and nice gloves (which are a tad too small) and I think my mom got me some Toblerone from her trip to India.  Molly got a plant for me.  Her parents got me some hot cocoa that they had sitting around and Molly gave me two of her brother's CDs (one of which I already have).  Katie sent me a beanbag which is on loan, which I think is a great thing because I was complaining to my mom and Molly how I wanted a bean bag or something becuase I like to sit somewhere else other than my bed or my chair to read.  Marc got me HUGBEES!  Thanks again everybody.<p>
  Oh yeah, on Thursday I bought my ticket for <a href="http://www.tmbg.com/">They Might Be Giants</a>.  I am sitting in Section three (of four) in Row C in seat 7.  So it's a good seat:)  Unfortunately I'm going Solo to it, but that's okay...  Also I may be going to see Moxy Fruvous next month.
