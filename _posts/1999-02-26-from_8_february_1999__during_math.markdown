title: "From: 8 February 1999, During Math"
excerpt: |
  I discovered Gausss theorem: <tt>n(n+1)/2</tt> on my own.  I wanted to see if I could add up some numbers on my calculator to get 666 (this was in eighth grade when Satan was cool).  So I was adding stuff up to 36 and got it.  It was somewhat tedious and I needed to figure a way to check my work.  Well I discovered something equivalent to <tt>n(n+1)/2</tt> that worked.  I didnt prove it.  I just tried it a lot and it worked.  I never thought much of it until a few years back when it was relevant to my course work.  I thought it was kinda cool.  So you see Satan inspires people to do math.  Calculators enable anybody to do math.
