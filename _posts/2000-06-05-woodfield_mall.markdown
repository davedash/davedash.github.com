title: Woodfield Mall
excerpt: |-
  Woodfield Mall is really cool.  If you are ever in the Chicagoland area, check it out.  It's a good sized mall.  2 and half floors and a ton of stores.  It's like the Mall of America with about half the stores and no theme park in the center.
  <p>While you are at the mall, be sure to eat at Stir Crazy where you can make your own stir fry dishes and they will cook it up for you.  Really good food.  You should all try it.
