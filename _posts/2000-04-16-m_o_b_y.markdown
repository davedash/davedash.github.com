  I went to see <a href="http://www.moby.org/">Moby</a> with "closing act" Bush.  To sum it up, I wish Bush was the openner for Moby.  Moby all out wins it for creativity and cool visual effects (as well as better music).  Bush knew how to work a crowd.
  <p>
  Moby was incredible.  I had floor tickets so we stormed to the front towards the stage when Moby began.  It opened with Novio blending into one of my favorite songs off of <a href="http://www.moby.org/reviews/play.html">Play</a> called Machette.   He played a lot of his songs from Play (<a href="http://www.moby.org/reviews/porcelain.html">Porcelain</a>, Natural Blues, Bodyrock and more).  He covered some truly amazing songs like the <a href="http://www.moby.org/reviews/bond.html">James Bond Theme</a> which he mixed with lots of other songs, including his own singing of Bring the Noise (Public Enemy).  Moby's henchman, Steve, even sang a jazzed up version of Stairway to Heaven.  The light show that accompanied his music was equally amazing.  It made him appear godlike at the very beginning and then he ended the show with an amazing light/sound show where he seemed god-like.
  </p>
  <p>
  I slept through a lot of Bush.  They were okay.  The sound seemed distorted, possibly due to me being in a bad pocket of sound in <a href="http://www.assembly.uiuc.edu">Assembly Hall</a>.  They opened with Machine Head, which was nice (it's a song I remember from the one album of theres I own).  They just went on for quite a while, but they played all the songs I liked from the first album.  Including a pseudo ending of Glycerine and a final ending of Little Things.  Inbetween those two songs was a cover of Break on Through (to the other side).
  </p>
  <p>I'm glad I got to see a good concert this year.  Hopefully I'll catch some good tunes in Chica-land.</p>
