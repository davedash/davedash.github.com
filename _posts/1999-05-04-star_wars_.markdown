title: STAR WARS!!!
excerpt: |-
  I bought the CD today!  It rules (listening to it as I type)!  I bought three posters 
  one is of the Queen, the other of Anakin in the sand, and the awesome Jedi 
  Battle!<p>
  I got these all at Meijer.  You can also find the Star Wars Episode 1 
  Story Book.  Don't read it unless you want to know the entire plot.
  <p>I'll also mention a few other things:
  <ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.din.or.jp/~toy/tb/tb20e.html">This</a> was my 
  desktop background, which has been replaced with a Star Wars background.
  <li>Matt Juggles.  My friends in Trench Coats Juggle.  Matt's from Colarado.  
  Hmmm.
  <li>I have terrible allergies that are killing me.
  <li><a href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/">Matt</a> is the reason why ftmax.com exists (I can explain further).
  <li>Allergies still killing me... allegra helps.
  <li>Emacs is good for editing web pages.
  </ul>
  Have fun... back to Star Wars.
