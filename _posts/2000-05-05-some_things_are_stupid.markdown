title: Some things are stupid
excerpt: |-
  At our school we have something before finals called "Reading Day."  Essentially it's one day for people to study their finals.  They didn't stop to think of course that we'd need more than the one day to study for finals.  I one final every week day until Thursday (luckily I didn't get any Saturday finals).  I just finished one and without further ado, I'll start studying for the next final.  Blah.  I want a week like some other schools do.  Imaging, a week for studying.  Heck, a couple of days would be sufficient.  Professors and TAs could schedule review sessions during those times too.
  <p>Anyway, I finished my final for today.  It went okay.  I have four more left.</p>
  <p>A number of people have asked if I'm coming to MN.  I'll be in MN by next Friday and then flying out to Chicago on the following Monday.  I'll be in town (Minneapolis) for memorial day weekend as well.
