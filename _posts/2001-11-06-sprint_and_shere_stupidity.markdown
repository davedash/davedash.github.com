Once again, I'm glad I'm not a Sprint customer.  Sprint's service is absolutely horrible - or maybe it is just my phone.  Apparently, however, they'll try to justify any of their ills.<!--more-->By sheer luck I happened upon a give-a-way of Motorola desktop/cell phone sets.  Its some sort of evaluation of suitable desktop phone replacements.  I.e. I think we want to get out of being screwed by Ameritech/SBC.

So the phone worked wonders until I started to notice that it lagged on network packets (via SMS, etc).  Still not enough to complain about for a free phone.

I took it home and tried using it and zilch.  I got nothing.  I know damn well that Motorola does manufacture cell phones that *do* work within my apartment even with Sprint service.  However I let the Sprint reps humour me.  They claimed that service isn't guaranteed indoors.

Who is supposed to be using these phones?  They certainly aren't designed for the outdoors (i.e. not very rugged).  Just how many people do you see outside using phones (besides people in cars).  So I did go outside and sure enough - the phone was still crappy and I could here modem noises (perhaps the phone trying to link with the mothership...).

So once again, I do not recommend the Sprint PCS service - it is not clear like their commercials would have you believe.  I now know why lying is considered a sin.
