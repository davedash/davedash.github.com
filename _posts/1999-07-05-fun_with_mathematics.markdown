title: Fun with mathematics!

  Ryan sent me this problem yesterday and when I first looked at it, I was going about it the wrong way and got bored and stopped doing it.  Today I looked at it again and figured it out very quickly.  The problem is as follows:
  <BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
  Grandma sent Johnny some money for his birthday. Johnny spent all of it in five stores. In each store, he spent $1.00 more than half of what he had when he came in. How much money did he get from grandma? 
  
  </EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
  What I first did was a poor method of trying to solve the problem.  I tried doing it forwards.  In other words, I assumed Johnny had x at store 1 and he spent x/2 - 1 at the first store and x - (x/2 - 1) at the second store and so on.  
  <p><B>Solution: </B>Don't read this if you want to figure it out on your own.  The easier way to figure it out seemed to be this figure out how much money he is left with at each store starting from store 5.  At store 5 he has no money.  Therefore we know that if he entered the store with x ammount of money then x - (1 + x/2) = 0 and therefore x = 2.  x = 2 is the ammount of money has when leaving store number four so we can do the same method to figure out that he came in with y dollars, where y - (1 + y/2) = 2.  We repeat this process until we figure out how much money he had to have at store 1 (which is how much his grandmother gave him).  I got $62.
  <p>This problem may seem trivial, especially to those of you who are mathematically inclined.  I just thought I'd share it with people since it is a good problem solving question.
