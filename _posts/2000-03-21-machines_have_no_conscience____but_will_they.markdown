title: Machines have no conscience... but will they?
excerpt: |-
  My favorite author (at least for now), Frank Herbert, depicts a universe that has developed thousands of years after freeing themselves from the enslavement of machines (see <i>Dune</i>).  Isaac Asimov who has written many interesting things regarding robots and machines depicts many scenarios including one where robots are so much more useful than people that people only have robots as their companions and become introverted (see the <i>Robot</i> series and the <i>Foundation</i> series).  Asimov also gives us a universe where robots are outlawed (<i>Foundation</i>).
  <p> I thought I'd write more on this topic just to encourage people to think about the issue of robots enslaving humanity or critically paralyzing humanity (through dependence, etc.).  However, this <a href='http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html'>article</a> that I found via <a href='http://slashdot.org/'>/.</a> will do the trick.  It's 11 pages, but at least skimming through is worthwhile.
