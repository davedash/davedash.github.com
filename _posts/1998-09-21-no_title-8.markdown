  This Saturday I had a talk with my roommate Jack about his Street Fighter addiction.  During lunch he asked, "You think that I don't have a life because I play Street Fighter all day?"  After a while human conversations become very silly because people tend to think a like.  I answered, "Yes."  I anticipated that he would try to find a similar flaw in me, due to the nature of his question.  "Well I can say that you have no life also, since you are in front of the computer all day.  At least that's what I see."  I replied calmly, "Yes, but I study using my computer."  I guess Jack is open to the fact that he has a severe video game addiction.  His main excuse is that this December there is a Street Fighter cometition in Chicago.  I hope he'll get wasted.<p>
  Anyway, Jack is getting less annoying, it's just that he needs discipline.  Like there is this towel that I think he uses for showering, and he leaves it on his chair all day.  That has to go.<p>
  Saturday my meal plan ran up, so I ate at <a href="http://www.bw-3.com/">BW-3</a>.  They have them in MN, WI, IL, OH, and PA.  I found out about them from Shang who went with me (he's from Ohio).  The food is good and very affordable.  I think that will be my Saturday dinner every week since wings are only $.25 on Saturday nights.<p>
  TMBG coming soon... I'm so busy, someone's gotta remind me.
  <p>Today I have two meetingish things.  I have a pre-lab for chem due tomorrow so I have to do that tonight.  I have to read some Chemistry.  I also have to write out my speech outline for the speech I am giving on Wednesday.  I have to have a quiz in Chemistry on wed.  Thursday is catch up on everything day.  Friday I have a presentation and my math is due.  I also am doing poorly in my math class.  Just barely racking more than 50% in graded homework.  Take the hardest UMTYMP take-home tests and assign the six problems that are proofs.  Choose four of those each week and that's what my assignments are like.  I have to try to do harder in this course.  I think after my September Cycle finishes I'll have catch-up time so I can read stuff for that class.  I have a test soon for that class too.
