title: Spyborgs
excerpt: |-
  Let's hear it for spyborgs.  I combined two of my favorite topics, spying and cyborgs, into one.  I'm going to create a small army of people who have all sorts of bionic instrumentation and they can perform reconnaissance missions.  Like one spyborg would be this person with video transmission built into her/his head so s/he could transmit data.
  <P>Living at the DCL for a time.
