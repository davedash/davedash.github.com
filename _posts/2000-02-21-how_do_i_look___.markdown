title: How do I look...
excerpt: An interesting eastern belief is that everything that we seek, our happiness, our God, our soul, etc. comes from within.  It is not a belief rather than a way of looking at things.  I like this outlook on things.  It keeps me whole and indestructable for all intents and purposes.
