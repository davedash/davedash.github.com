title: Homemaker...
excerpt: |-
  It's my third year before college, and I'm reevaluating what I want to do in life.  So far I've decided tbat it's not CS that I want to do.  So I've been milling over several occupations.  Media Scientist?  Politician?  Professor?  Well I've decided the perfect job for me would be homemaker.  I just need a wife to be my breadwinner.
  <p>
  Now you might be thinking, "Dave, you lazy bum, wow, damn, are you lazy."  Hold on though.  (I bet my Jewish analogue, Marc, sees where I'm at here).  I like to cook.  I like to not work in offices.  Two really good signs that I'd be a great homemaker.  I like cooking so much, that I study it.  No, not going to a culinary arts academy, but from family.  My entire immediate family (minus my dad) can cook very well in their respective fields.  Granted the dark side of cooking (microwaves and convenience) have gotten the better of my mom, but my brother's kitchen (no microwave) more than makes up for it.
  </p><p>
  So I've been thinking about my kitchen.  What would I have in there.  Well voice activated video system for one.  You know how when you fry something you need to stir frequently?  Yeah, that gets boring fast.  In my kitchen, I'd like to be able to say, "TV-on, Batman Beyond" and with some brilliant mixture of TiVOs, Voice Recognition software and Video consoles my orders would be executed.  
  </p> <p>
  Now you might be thinking, "Dave Dash, you're family spent how much to put you through college?  And you want to cook?"  So, what else would I do besides cooking?  I like to read and write.  College has helped that immensely.  I think I'd probably run for local office or something.  I like Media and Politics (sure, not your usual Comp. Sci Major).  So I'd do stuff in that area.  Broad social impacts, that's me.  Enough talk... I go read now.
