excerpt: I just came back from Cinema on the Quad which moved to it's rain location at Foellinger Auditorium.  It was an interesting movie, but I was bored for the most part.  Maybe this had to do with all the hype and whatnot and the environment wasn't right.  It was funny when someone in the back screamed in the middle of the movie.  I still don't see what took $30K to make that movie.
