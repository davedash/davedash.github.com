Predictable unpredictability: Week 5-7

I decided to cover three weeks at a time as things are becoming a bit more
stable.  As always, things have gotten considerably easier.  Most things
aren't worrying us.  Most days have been considerably easier.  There's still
tough days where I feel like I can't console him, but we're usually able to
figure things out.

Right now the real fright is the [Whooping cough][w].  Our pediatrician, who is
normally calm and relaxed about everything, was very freaked out about the
epidemic.

Katie's doing a fantastic job, despite having considerable breastfeeding woes.

We also have an issue with green stools, but Katie's been altering her diet so
we should see some new results.

Here's some new things we've noticed halfway past the [4th trimester][4t]:

* I put in a half-day in the office.
* Katie can still cook like a champ!
* Siddhartha smiles a lot, especially if you play games with him.
* His hands seem more coordinated.
* Often he wakes up without crying.
* He's slept 7+ hours on a number of occasions and we can count on at least 4
  hours.
* He's over 10 lbs and 22 inches.
* He flails his arms less when he's nursing.
* We've been managing all on our own for over two weeks.
* Katie drove to somewhere with nobody in the back seat to soothe the baby.
* Katie's taken a bath and shower with him a few times.
* He sleeps in his swing for quite some time.
* We've gone out with him on a few occasions with no major troubles.
