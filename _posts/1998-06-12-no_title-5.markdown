title: ADSL
excerpt: |-
  It turns out that I cannot get ADSL service quite yet.  Which is good, it saves me $120 for this summer.<p>
  Although, I'm sure later this summer it will debut.  By next year I intend to get something similar in the summer (unless I'm working away from home, which I may).  By then, Sprints wonder-line should debut, and thus the prices for both ADSL and Sprint's line would be very affordable.
