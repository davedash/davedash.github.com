I decided to install [Democracy] for [WordPress].  This was partially inspired by [Darren's post at Problogger][p] and for my own development efforts for the [restaurant review site][rbu].  Not sure if it allows you to change your vote, that would be useful for the first poll.  I suppose we'll find out.

So the first poll is deciding on the next feature to implement for [reviewsby.us][rbu].  I've seeded it with some of the top requests I've heard/felt.  But I'd like to hear other peoples ideas.  If you're not familiar with the site, [take a look][rbu] and tell me what you think. 

**Note:** For most people the poll is on the left sidebar.
