I'm a sucker for organizing things, and the drag and drop demo on the [hiTask homepage][hiTask] won me over with the ability to connect tasks to schedules to people.  


They create buckets where you can dump information.  For example, you can put things into various projects, or color it a certain way or organize things by when they need to get done.  You can even schedule with some precision *when* do something.

I've only been using it one day and it does fall short in a few areas:

* I need to be able to edit multiple attributes at a time, quickly.  For example, I need something that has to be done today at 5pm for my house, I don't want to have to do 3 separate tasks.
* I want to view my descriptions/notes without going to edit mode.  Sometimes I put URLs in there (e.g. pay credit card links to my credit card web site).
* Repeating to-do list items... this would rock.

I do like the little news notice at the top.  Got me interested in the news for the site.
