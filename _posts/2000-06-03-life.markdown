  So... Over the last month I finished school, started an internship and visited my home twice with plans to visit once more.
  <p>
  The finale of school was well awaited.  I think I'd enjoy school much more if I took less courses.  So I plan on doing as such.  I may even take the minimum ammount if I can get away with it.  I like school, but in moderation.  Save for my Child Psych class which has an undertermined grade and my Math grade which was a lowly B- I aced this semester.  I wasn't too sure that I would.  Well wait, I should have gottena  better math grade.  Damnit.  I wish I never took that Math class.  I just found out I would have had a perfect 4.0.  Wow... I did well.  I've surprised myself.  Cool.  Dude... grad school here I come eventually.  Okay wow, hard work does pay off.
  </p>
  <p>Internship has gotten a lot better.  If you talked/emailed with me during my first couple weeks (e.g. as M. Kate did) you'd have thought I hated my job completely.  Now I tolerate it.  I've learned that the job is fine.  It is not what I wish to do forever, but for now it is fine.  I am also supplied with monetary reimbursements from Motorola and can use that to purchase gadgets.
  </p><p>
  Visiting home was nice, but I'm bound to do it again for Father's day weekend (if you didn't get an itinerary from me, father's day is on the 18th of June).  So I'll be hanging out with my parents (I owe them for not hanging out during Memorial Day Weekend).  The amusing thing is, Marc will probably need to come over to do his laundry by then, if he hasn't already.  (My family has adopted Marc after his parents left for Texas).
  </p>
  <p>I came back from a party of mostly Motorola Interns.  It was a nice crowd.  I hope I can tolerate them (they're good people) for the next two months.  I've got a bunch of new CDs as well (I've only listened to Pet Shop Boys' <i>Nightlife</i> about a million times).  I'm on the prowl to purchase a new cellular telephone since I can get very good rates.  Anyhoo... for those of you who think I'm not keeping in touch with you, just drop me a line and complain.
