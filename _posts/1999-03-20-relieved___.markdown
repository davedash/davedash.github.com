  Well I have less homework tha I thought I had.
  <p>
  Turns out one of the papers I have is due in a week or so.  I will put
   it off since I am very very tired.  From Sunday night to Thursday
   night I've been constantly working on my speech and the paper that 
  goes along with the speech.  I've never really had a chance to enjoy
   my vacation.  In addition, I've had this horrible cold which still
   lingers and in addition with my allergies it creates this 
  excruciatingly painful feeling in my right arm.
  <p>Thursday night Molly came back.  She's been sick from Mountain Dew 
  so together we form this ill couple.
  <p>I think today I am going to pack all my stuff.  I had some though provoking material to tell you, but I am too tired to do anything about it.
  <p>I'm thinking of Linuxing my computer at school and running Windows 98 on top of it via VMware.  Message me if you have any strong opinions for or against this.
