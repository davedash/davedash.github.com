title: Khan and the Internet
excerpt: |-
  Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan is awesome.  Unfortuantely I am too lazy to see if there is some sort of discussion forum place where people can just chat about how cool Khan is.
  <p>
  Public Spaces seems to be the newest interest of mine.  There are very limited public spaces on the internet... actually there are none.  Internet is a pull architecture for the most part.  We pull content from web sites and whatnot, We never push things to the world.  That's why I like the real world so much.
