  Here's your update <a href="http://cgi-resources.com/">Matt</a> and <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/ph/www/grinham/">CJ</a>:
  <p>So Wednesday at 2AM or so the fire alarms went out after a power
  outage and then a return of power.  It was very annoying.  My sleeping 
  patterns have been off for too long.
  <p>Trench coats incite violence.  I shall be more weary of my trench-coat 
  bearing friends.  I could easily see them concealing weapons.
  <p>I've done a complete 180 turn in web design.  I used to design based on
  IE 4.0/5.0 rendering.  Now I design primarily for Netscape or whatever 
  hideous browser I'm using.  I just thought it was neat that there was a 
  time when I didn't care if it didn't work in Netscape.
  <p><a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/">UIUC</A> dropped from 5th to 185th most 
  wired dorm.  I could go on and on about how much the network here sucks.  
  Now I can correct all the administrators when they say we are one of the most wired 
  dorms in the nation.
  <p>You know what's funny?  Replying to very old email from <a href="http://www.worldwidemart.net/scripts/">Matt's Script Archives</a>. 
  People ask really easy questions.  I don't even know PERL that well.
  <p>Here's another something from <a href="http://www.jawed.com/">J-Weed</a>:
  <blockquote><tt>
  Jawed: why am I publicizing this shit like a mor*n?
  Dave : Yeah, real publicizing.  Do you want me to put this on ftmax.com?
  Jawed: yea
  </tt></blockquote>
  <p>Actually, speaking of publicizing... Matt and CJ found a journal of someone's in the basement... 
  I could transcribe it here.
