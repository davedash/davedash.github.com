excerpt: |-
  My right hand Jew-Man, Marc Gutman was <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/00/09/25/1646235.shtml">forever temporarily immortalized</a> on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">/.</a>.  His words were, "Dude!  I know."
  <p>In other news...
  <a href="http://www.flatoday.com/space/explore/stories/2000b/092400b.htm">The X-33 may not fly</a>.  That saddens me.  The X-33 is a space-plane that is a replacement for the Space Shuttle.  It's reusability will likely cause NASA to do more stuff in space expanding our planets knowledge of space.  It will be the precursor to the Venture Star which will undoubtedly be the coolest thing to come out of earth for a while.  Eventually we will evolve into more flexible means of transport systems such as galactic space cruisers which make use of worm-holes to jump from one point in space to another instantly.  We will gradually make contact with other life forms that look different.  Possibly an entire planet composed of bug-like creatures that live in a way so foreign to us that their day to day activities will scare both races into an aggressive state.  Eventually war will break lose and millions will die.  Perhaps under such stress human ingenuity will come into factor and we will come to a stand-still with our bug-like aliens.  We will train our psychologists and other scientists to try to understand the bug-races ways until we the people can learn to live with them in our universe.  We will make treaties and share information and better both races.  Therefore you should write to your congressperson and request that they support funding the X-33.
