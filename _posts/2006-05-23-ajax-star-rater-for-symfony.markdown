Francois from the [symfony project][symfony] beat me to the punch.  I was going to post a detailed how-to on adding a star-rater to your web site (similar to the [one's I created for reviewsby.us][s1]), but for most of you [this should do the trick][sr].  Unless people request it sooner, I'll hold off on publishing the details on my star-rater for a while.  It only offers a few minor differences (<acronym title="In My Opinion">IMO</acronym> advantages) to this snippet.
