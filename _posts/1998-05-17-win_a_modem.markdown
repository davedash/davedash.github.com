title: Win a modem!
excerpt: Okay, this isn't something that I can just ICQ to everybody about.  I mean, it's different from winning a computer.  Almost everyone wants a new computer or would know what to do with one.  Alot of people would know what to do with a modem, but are too stuck up on their T1 connections.  Anyway... <a href="http://www.computers.com/">Computers.com</a> is giving away the modem of your choice.  This includes ISDN modems.  I suggest everybody should register.  If you win a modem and can't use it, I sure could use an extra modem.  If you don't have ISDN, I'd go with a 3COM/US Robotics Courier V.Everything 56k.  It's the exact same modem that I use currently with 56k technology.  I bought my modem over two/two and a half years ago directly from US Robotics.  I did not regret it.  It was the best modem that I could buy at the time (and I got a hell of a deal on it, $264 or something, compared to the estimated $400 retail).
