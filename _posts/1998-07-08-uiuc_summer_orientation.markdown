title: UIUC Summer Orientation
excerpt: It is really hot down here.  I'm typing this via telnet, so I am not used to the way the screen looks.  So forgive me if I have no formatting.  Anyway I'll be picking classes in a few minutes.  I will be majoring in Math & Computer Science and that's about it so far.  The weather isn't the greatest... just all around crappy.  I did find out my residence hall is really cool.  Anyway I head home tonight, should be there tomorrow.
