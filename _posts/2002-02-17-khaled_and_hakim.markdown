title: Khaled and Hakim
excerpt: So the night before flying to Berkeley Ahmed, Hadeel, some others and I went to see Hakim and Khaled.  Hakim was alright... some Egyptian dude... Khaled was great.  At least for a few songs it was excellent, like El Habra Wine which was the finale song.  Totally put people in an upbeat mood.
