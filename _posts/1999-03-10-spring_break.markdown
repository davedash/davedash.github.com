title: Spring Break
excerpt: "BTW, if you are wondering when I'll be back for spring break.  I leave Friday at night for MSP from MDW (cutting my ticket cost down by 66%).  I'll be there until the 21st.  If you want even more details, I can give them to you.  Warning.  An irate Matt Wright who wrote some <a href=\"http://www.cgi-perl.com/\">books</a> on Perl is driving up to Minnesota... possibly with the intent to run me over.  "
