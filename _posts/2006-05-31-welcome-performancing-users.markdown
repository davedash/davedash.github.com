Yesterday I took advantage of the [Performancing launchpad][l] to [announce reviewsby.us to the blogging world][a].  Jumping at the opportunity was smart, I was the second site on the [launchpad][l] and made it to the [homepage][p].  As a result, I had probably my largest day of traffic (it's not a whole lot, but it's definitely noticeable in these early stages).

We also got a few new users and a [few new restaurants][rbu].  So check it out.
