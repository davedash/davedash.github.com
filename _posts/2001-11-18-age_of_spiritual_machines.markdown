I finished reading this book a few weeks ago (although I purchased it over a year ago...).  <i>Age of Spiritual Machines</i> is Ray Kurzweil's prophesy of where computation/computers is going.<!--more-->He begins by establishing some theories on technical advancement from the onset of the cosmos.  Noting historical landmarks along the way bringing us up to present times.  Using his theories he establishes a possible future scenario of machines achieving human-degrees of computational power and eventually transcending computation into spirituality - in otherwords being.  <p>Essentially its an evolution of man and machine together.  It is an interesting and frightening outlook of technology and the future of humanity.</p><p>Kurzweil is an optimist in regards of human-ability to create a technology that will eventually propogate itself into consciousness.  Nonetheless, this is someone who has a record of noticing trends and making sound predictions that ring true.</p>
