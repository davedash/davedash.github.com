title: Bloomington + Valleyfair
excerpt: Tuesday Adam came over and we went to Home Depot looking for something with which to measure interior angles and could not find the propper device.  Later we decided we didn't need it anyhow.  We went to Bloomington so I could show him my old stuff and of that stuff we visited the libraries.  Actually we went from one part of town to the other in five minutes in order to get a copy of <i>Foundation and Earth</i> before closing.  Later we went to McDonalds.  McDonalds is so nasty.  We got like a 20pack of chicken McNuggets with Szechuan sauce.  I will never eat that many McNuggets again.  The sauce was okay.<p>Yesterday Molly and I went to Valley Fair with the SEI 1 group (part of the <a href=http://www.math.umn.edu/itcep>ITCEP</a> deal).  It was fun.  Rather the water park was fun.  Everything else was mediocre.  I mean the roller coasters are not that great anymore.<p>Would anybody be interested in going to the Wave Pool in Anoka?  Laureen was thinking this Sunday.  I think I'll be able to make it.  Adam said he would too.  If your interested ICQ me.  I suggest if you want to go, just find a few others who are going and go with them.  No need to go as one huge group, nor is there need to go solo.
