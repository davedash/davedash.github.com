So I finally got around to seeing Three Kings.  A movie that takes place in post-ceasefire Iraq.  Its a story that exemplifies the problem with US foreign policy.<!--more-->The story has a &quot;happy ending&quot; so to speak, but it really makes you understand the tragedy of wars.  The insane ammount of bombing we do to the civilian population of countries ruled by dictators.

In an ideal world, the US Soldiers would clean up after they are are done &quot;playing.&quot;  They would set things right in a country.  Not kick the ass around of a country and expect it to get better.  Not to bomb the very people who could oppose a dictatorship.

This movie made me want to go into Iraq, with my own personal defensive army and liberate it.

We should stop bombing Afghanistan.  Bombing civilians in order to change policy is a failed policy.
