title: Bjork the other white meat
excerpt: I'm listening to Bjork's Hyperballad (Brodsky Quartet).  I like the song very much.  A long time ago I imagined having a huge office and a bunch of musicians that would play for me when I asked them to do so.  I'd have them play this song a lot.  As far as the non Quartet pieces go, I'd have my spies capture a cellular sample from Bjork and quickly generate a duplicate that has all of Bjork's memories with a slight adjustment making her loyal to me (otherwise she might choose to flee and become a real musician).  I will at least try most of this.
