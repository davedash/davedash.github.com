  This Thursday I went to the <a href="http://www.beckman.uiuc.edu/">Beckman Institute</a> for a meeting.  Wow!  The Beckman is incredible.  Everything beyond DCL is really nice, in fact.  There's this nice patch of grass where you can lay about (it was a nice day, so I was tempted).  There is also an interesting fountain and then the entry way into the institute is really nice too.  Off to the side there is even a large gate.  The inside was just as wonderful.  I went to the fifth floor which is reminiscent of the geometry center offices (at its older location).
  <p>
  So at this meeting I found out what my new job entails.  By next week I'll officially work for the college of education for the <a href="http://chickscope.beckman.uiuc.edu/">Chickscope Project</a>.  I'll be working on the pages that the teachers use (I don't have a URL for you now).  Trying to make it visually appealing like the Chickscope's main pages.
  
  <p>According to KQRS, some kid at Hopkins North Junior High (my former junior high school) brought a gun to school.   That's pretty freaky.  They say they are going to expel him for a year, but I wonder what he's going to do in that year.
  
  <p>Orbital and Underworld remixes of DM are pretty darn good.  Of course, it helps that all three bands are really good to begin with.
  <p>No thanks to Molly, here's a link to a page about <a href="http://wso.williams.edu/~rfoxwell/starwars/SWPants.htm">pants and Star Wars</a>.
