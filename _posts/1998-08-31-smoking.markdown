title: Smoking
excerpt: Why does he leave the TV on when he's doing his homework?  What the heck is wrong with this kid?<p>Well the <a href="http://www.library.uiuc.edu/">library</a> does not have me listed and won't for a few days nor do they have <i>Heretics of Dune</i>.  However ISR (a local res-hall) has it and they will loan it to me tomorrow as long as they have it unchecked out.  They probably do since nobody likes to read.<p>I hate people who smoke.  Especially if I see them smoke.  I hope my roommmate gets cancer and dies.  I hope he gets it while watching football.  No I hope he's at a football game and a football hits him in the face while he smokes and it shoves the cigarette into his throat and then he dies.<p>That's my rant for right now.  I may regret saying that, but if I do, I'll just delete that part of the entry.  The general idea is, don't smoke around me, or don't let me know you smoke.  Especially if I have to live with you.

For historical purposes, I sort of wish to keep it here.  I might change my mind later.  *5/26/2006*)  The general idea is, don't smoke around me, or don't let me know you smoke.
