title: Correlation of illness and tests
excerpt: |
  The last time I was attacked by several tests I also became ill.  I remember the <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/ph/www/chip">professor</a> I work under saying something along the lines of "I hope you aren't sick because of the tests."  How very strange.  Today I am reading through my Child Psychology notes.  Tonight I'll be reading an article related to Child Psych as well.  Tomorrow I take the test.  Hi, Erin.  After the test I write a paragraph in Hindi.  After my Hindi class I read four books of the Odyssey.  This weekend I do a math assignment (I got a satisfactory score on the test!) and study for a CS exam (for which I am brutishly under prepared).
