title: I went bowling?
excerpt: |-
  Today has been pretty cool.  Despite missing my 10 o'clock and having my unhealing suture on my eye bleed on me during JKD it's been fun.
  <P>I bought a new watch to replace my missing Timex Indiglo.  I had one of those old ones with the small metal buttons and it was just mostly inconvenient to use.  This new Armitron watch is nice though.  It looks really cool... like I'm from space.  Man it is cool being from space.  All that for $26.  $26 bucks makes you from space... what a cool-sweet deal.
  <P>I also got some mattress pad just to see if that helps... we'll find out... ah yes... I'm back into doing the "..." stuff in the journals...
  <P>So then I went to play some pool and I decided not to bowl.  It was good wholesome fun.  [Note: Dan Lavenda if you are reading this entry you may stop now, the rest of this does not apply to you.] Then I went to Whitney's, the 4S RA's, room to watch <I>Mighty Aphrodite</I>.  I originally saw most of it in my humanities class.  I am glad I finished the movie, because it was really funny.  This is all.
