title: What to do with my life...
excerpt: |-
  I'm starting to wonder what I want to do with my life as a whole.  I always try to think of end goals or purposes.  Not mine specifically, but for some greater entity.  Perhaps humanity as a whole.
  <p>
  I however question siding with humanity soley because it is a default.  I am a member of humanity, so I wish to advance humanity.  If I were a member of any other species, I'd side with it.  I suppose that could be okay.  Now, I think, perhaps my alignment should be for all ecology.  Why limit myself to humans?  I should also support the eco-system that supports the life.  This just gets into a too over-bearing task.  Eventually you start to wonder, "what is the point of it all?"  So perhaps there isn't.  Let's bank on the fact that there is, however. </p>
  <p>It's not too much to change short term goals into short term goals with extensibility into long term goals.  Meaning: do things that benefit you now, but if there is a possibility of building on something go for it.  I don't want to get into a situation where I'm doing something I do not enjoy for too long of a time in order to get some benefit in the end.  That's funny... it almost sounds like a defense against authoratarian religions.  I don't want to go to church every Sunday to get into heaven.  I want to do things that I enjoy.  Then again, church can be something other than uncomfortable.  Then the rewards of going to church would be intrinsic as well as having a long-term benefit.  Note: church/heaven can mean anything.  At any moment life my end and it will be a life of misery if the end goal didn't come through, unless you enjoyed living life.  Then it matters not whether the end goal comes through or doesn't.
  </p>
  <p>
  Take it easy everybody.
