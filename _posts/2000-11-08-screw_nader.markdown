title: Screw Nader
excerpt: |-
  Sorry for being such a Gore-supporter, but screw Nader for ... yes, stealing votes from Gore.  Actually screw all of you who voted for Nader without knowing if your state was divided between Bush or Gore.
  <p>
  The margin is so damn small, I pray for a recount.
  </p>
  <p>
  I suspect Bush might be president, so I may be abroad for the next four years as much as possible.  Good night.
  </p><p>
  update: according to adam there is a recount... more to come, gore is winning</p>
