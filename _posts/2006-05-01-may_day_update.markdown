  There's now an [about page][r1] on the site.  One thing the site somewhat lacks is a compelling reason to contribute to it.  I can get vistor upon visitor, but it's not going to make anybody want to get an account (a free one at that) unless there is a clear and obvious reason to contribute reviews.
  
  So let's state the obvious.  My personal use of the site is to keep track of what I've ordered and whether or not I've liked it.  If I have to go to the [Cheesecake Factory][r2], I'll know to order the [Orange Chicken][r3] and not the [Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp][r4].  I check the site just before I go anywhere I've been before.  In the future, I hope I can check the site before I go anywhere even if I've never been.

I also changed some titles so they're more explicit, hyperlinked more things in the tag section and fixed a few bugs with indexing restaurants.
