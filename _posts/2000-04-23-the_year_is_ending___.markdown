title: The year is ending...
excerpt: |-
  Someone else (Anne) has left school early.  She's off too London and Aberdeen.  It's not, however, that early. 
  <p>
  Schools finishing quickly and I am getting all these last minute projects, papers, assignments completed, yet... it seems this is the least busy I have been in a while.
  </p><p>
  In a couple of weeks I'll be working in Chicagoland.  Still haven't settled my move-in date, but I'll find a way.  I think I will be up in Minnesota for the upcomming Memorial Day weekend.  Perhaps I'll see some of you.  Or it could turn out that I see none of you.  I don't know who looks at this page anymore.  If you put a million monkeys on a million web browsers, eventually they'd get to this site.
