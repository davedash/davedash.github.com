title: Addiction
excerpt: My $20,000/day landmine addiction is causing great damage to my financial stability.  I've got to stop.  I just can't help myself.  I order landmines from the net and just test them in open fields.  Unfortunately landmines are an expensive luxury item.  Well I better stop blowing up stuff.  I better stick to a cheaper addiction... like Pokemon.
