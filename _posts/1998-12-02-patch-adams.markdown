  I saw the trailer for <i>Patch Adams</i> today.  I think I will see Patch Adams (that's 
  right, without italics) and his movie.  He'll be coming to live at Allen Hall in February.  I'm uncertain whether the movie has been released or not.  They said it premiered in October, but the release is in December.
  <p><i>Xenocide</i>... I read the back of the book and it sounds silly.  592 pages... a normal sized book, after reading <i>Dune</i> books.  I'll order <i>Children of the Mind</i> sometime this week.  Maybe tonight.
  <p>This <a href="http://cnn.com/TECH/science/9811/30/laser.pens/">link</a>'s for Yishan and others with laser pointers.
  <p>Little to say these days.  I have a lot of tests this week and next week and then finals the week after that.  Then I go home... I'll update the <a href="http://www.ftmax.com/calendar.php3/" target=_self>Calendar</a>.
