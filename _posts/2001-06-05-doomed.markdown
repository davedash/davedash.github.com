excerpt: Suburbs totally cater to consumption.  Well this one, especially.  It's like a giant Mall and its inhabitants are mall rats.  This Mall of a township/village lures you to consume.  Giant attractive stores and restaurants are begging you to try something.  No, Borders, I do not want to buy any NY Times best sellers at thirty percent off.  I'd rather eat rancid tuna.
