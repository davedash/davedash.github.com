title: I love UI
excerpt: |-
  I've decided that I love this University.  Not because it is anything special, but because I think that's how the University wants me to feel.  No wait what the hell am I saying.  No the <a href=http://www.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois</a> is a very decent school.  I don't know why I like it, but I do for some reason.  Maybe the good balance with academics and cultural diversity, etc.  I dunno.  Probably because it has a large library.  A library that gives away good cookies.<p>
  Well speaking of, thanks to the Residence Hall Interlibrary system, I have <i>Heretics of Dune</i>.<p>
  My class schedule is slowly getting smaller and it looks like school will suck only once in a while instead of twice.  The food service in Allen is poor.  Today I had snickers ice cream from Edy's that was good.  It was bad when the machine didn't work during dinner time.  Grr.  The food was bad for dinner, I didn't eat much.  The hot cocoa machine still does not work.  Woe is me.<p><a href="http://www.housing.uiuc.edu/academics/unit1/">Unit One</a> is really cool.  This week we have <a href="http://www.webcom.com/empower/">Barbara Trent</a>, Oscar award winner of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Panama+Deception,+The+(1992)">The Panama Deception</a>.  I went to a talk yesterday and she talked about all these cool programs she was involved with.   She talked about how she fled from the FBI.  She talked about how she made movies that exposed the government.  Yesterday I watched some of her other movie, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Cover+Up+(1988)">Cover Up: Behind The Iran Contra Affair</a>.  I watched some of it because it was too cold for me in the main hall.  Today I will dress appropriately and watch the Panama Deception and hopefully stay for discussion.  The fact that I can do this in my own hall is just so neat.  I mean talking about all these cool issues with some person who has a shiny award that sits at the Front Desk of our hall and stuff.  Wow, Allen Hall is cool.<p>My best friend in the whole wide world got her ICQ password today.
