title: "\"Can my grandmother die twice in a semester?\""
excerpt: |-
  Well my luggage managed to not come off my plane with me.  Eric and Travis picked me up and we went to get Karl.  Along the way they explained what a dumb decision I made by not jumping at the $400-$600 bump.  We got Karl and Jawed from the Amtrak station and then went to Allen Hall.
  <p>I got everything setup in my room just like it used to be, said hello to the gang, got Pokey sticks etc.  I also managed to not get in touch with my luggage because they called and left a message on my phone when I was out.  So I got it this morning.
  <p>Classes seem nice so far.  My CS 173 professor is promising.  He supplied the above question.  Physics Lab seems okay, if not way beneath my level.  Philosophy was too tiring so I slept.  They'll try to prevent me from doing that I bet.  And my final class is from 4 to 6 tonight (Java Lab).  I don't like that.  Oh well, I have to deal with it.  I also have to deal with very expensive books.  
  <p>My roommate looks stupider than ever with Silver hair, etc.  I still dislike him for the pre-Thanksgiving reasons (Street Fighter, stupid stupid China man, etc).
  <p>Caroline has been using this page to e-stalk me... I suppose that's what it's for.
