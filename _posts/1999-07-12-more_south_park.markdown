title: More South Park
excerpt: |-
  Wow, Tom Bernard from KQRS did not like the South Park movie, even though he liked the show. 
  <P>I decided that I don't mind that the TV shows are going to be far less cool than the movie.  Because if you think about it, most movies that have been made into shows suck.  There are a few notable exceptions, like Batman (although it's based off the comics too).  Same goes for Superman.
