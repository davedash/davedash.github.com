title: Batman Beyond
excerpt: Batman Beyond is so cool.  I saw today's episode, <I>Bloodsport</I>.  It had bloodshed, and for the most part death.  They don't try to cover up fatalities like in other cartoons where they explain everything that could be construed as death as some none-death related activity.  Also, the music is still killer.  I'll definitely order it once I reach Urbana.
