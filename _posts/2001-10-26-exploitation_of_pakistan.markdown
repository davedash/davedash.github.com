The world has just got to stop exploiting each other.  Here's an <a href='http://argument.independent.co.uk/commentators/story.jsp?story=101459'>article from Robert Fisk</a> of how the West (US, Britain) is (re-)exploiting Pakistan.<!--more-->I'm not talking about goading Pakistan into war, I'm referring to how the US will make any effort necessary to exercise their hegemony, and that typically means you need a dictatorship.  If there was some form of democracy, I think the US would fear that the Pakistanis would democratically decide to not agree with the US - for shame...<p>I'd go on, but the other point I wanted to make is that India needs to be slapped in the face.  Its rude to begin a war in Kashmir at this moment.  Pakistan has enough on its plate, it doesn't need another war to contend.  Plus, military occupation is not, in this authors opinion, steps to self-determination to which the Kashmiris are entitled.</p>
