title: Day 13 No Molly (Sunday)
excerpt: |-
  It appears that I no longer have my University of Minnesota Email account.  This is a small loss.<p>
  Well yesterday we went to the Uptown Art Fair.  I didn't enjoy it as much as I did in years earlier because it was not only very hot, but I refrained from buying refreshments (or rather having my brother get refreshments).  I went with a group of friends: Zach, Adam, Tanya, Jesse, Jesse's cousin, Yishan, Marc, Dan Lavenda and Katie.  We were later joined mysteriously by Laureen.  I think our problem was that we went as a large group.  We split off into a group of 3 and a group of 8.  8 doesn't work.  When I went with my brother we were usually 4, maximum.  I'm sure if Molly were here we would have gone off on our own.  I should make a list of why it's good for me to have Molly around.<p>Most of us ate at Uptown Express.  They can make anything.  I had a Gyro.  Dan and Laureen got an interesting plate of food from the Cuban Food place.  It looked good and I should have opted for it.<p>AFter that we went to the Improv in the Park at the Lake Harriet Rose Gardens.  Most of us got there pretty early (all but Tanya, Marc, Laureen and Adam, because Adam couldn't find his car).  Yishan was feeling weak and worn out so everyone but me went in cars to the Lake Harriet Bandshell.  While I waited for Adam's car of people I walked around the rose gardens and the surrounding area.  The place by the parking lot was pretty.  It was a bunch of rocks and some water.  It reminded me of this place me and one of my cousins visited in India.  They had some neat fountains at the Rose Gardens that were nice too.<p>Eventually everyone came back and we watched the Improv.  All I have to say is that Dr. Doug, my teacher, and this one other girl, seemed to be on a different level than the other people in the troupe.  Parts of it were funny though.  I think the audience was easily amused.<p>Dark ominous clouds formed and then started to rain heavily just as the show ended.  We ran to a shelter and decided to go to my house and watch a movie.  Ryan Hayle, again, showed up at the Rose Gardens very late missing almost everything.  The whole lot of us went to my house and we watched a few people play Super Mario brothers and eventually Katie and Dan brought home the <i>Full Monty</i>.  I had a headache by then, which seems to be a recurring thing (I think it's my lack of water intake).  What I saw of the movie was somewhat amusing.  I wouldn't have rented it myself though.<p>Overall it was a pretty nice day.
