excerpt: Well I'm back to 4.55 GB of Hard Drive space.  It really isn't that bad.  It just means I had to let go of some MP3s.  I went to <a href="http://www.mbe.com">Mail Boxes Etc.</a>, which was very helpful.  I shipped the drive to <a href="http://www.seagate.com/">Seagate</a> and it came out to $21.22 which covers packaging, shipping and insurance.  A bit pricy, but for a $540 (actually shit... that was $590... oh well hope nothing happens to it) hard drive I think it's okay.  The drive will arrive next Thursday and they ship me a new one a week later and I should get that around 21 October.  That's a long time I guess.  But I can wait.
