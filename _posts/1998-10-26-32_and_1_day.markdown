excerpt: "I have a short term memory.  I noticed this last year when I started using ICQ heavily.  I'd message people and they'd reply and I would have to constantly look at my message history to figure out what they were replying to.  This happens less and less, but it was disturbing dealing with such a short term memory.  I've started to notice it elsewhere as well.  I can't pay much attention in class because taking notes is difficult and keeping a lecture together in my head is hard.  When I read a book I often miss important details.  This happens especially if the subject matter isn't filled with vivid description or interesting.<p>\r\n\
  I've started taking it easy instead of constantly being stresse over work.  It's helped.  It's funny my hobby is web site development and I chose the school that created graphical web browsing.  It's fun to go to <u>H</u>elp|<u>A</u>bout Internet Explorer if you use MSIE.  If you like space, you'll like <a href=http://cnn.com/TECH/space/9810/24/deep.space.01/\">this</a>.\r\n\
  Our school has crappy Pizza delivery.  It's just Totino's party pizza.  It's nasty.  If you go to UIUC, eat dinner, don't get the pizza from URH, if you must spend $5 and order pizza.<p>\r\n\
  <a href=\"http://www.winamp.com/\">Winamp</a> 2.04 has Aural Stimulation support for MP3s.  I hope this is what I think it is.  In other MP3 news, I just found a bunch of new MP3s from Aphex Twin, Tangerine Dream, Orb (an awesome live Toxygene), Orbital (as if I didn't have enough), Skinny Puppy and Underworld to name a few.  I should be set for a while.<p>The Simpsons yesterday lacked some intelligence that the older Tree House of Horror's had.<p>Jack is back today.  He woke up early (a few minutes after my final awakening).  He's awake now.  "
