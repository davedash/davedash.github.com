I've also jumped on the [Google Analytics][u] bandwagon and added a lot of the sites in "family."  If you're familiar with Urchin, it has a similar feel to it.  It almost feels a bit lighter feature-wise.  There's a few issues I will take with it:

* When they list links to your site (e.g. /login) they don't hyperlink it.
* I'd like to drill down to raw data.  I like to make my own correlations.  Heck, I want to drill down to see if I should filter someone from the list.

Other than that, I like the potential that this will offer me.  This combined with [Google Sitemaps][g] will provide powerful analysis of the site.  As it stands, [Katie] and I should be eating at the [Cheesecake Factory][c] and [non-chain restaurants][n] as we seem to do well in the ranks and I need to write more [about maps][m].
