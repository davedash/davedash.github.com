title: You really should eat your vegetables.
excerpt: |-
  Frisbee is really cool when played in the hallways.  Well until 
  <a href="http://www.jawed.com/">Jawed</a> cuts your head off.  Or as 
  the case may be, until the frisbee shatters.
  <p>I got this email regarding the National Gas Out on some day like 
  the 30th of this month.  Basically don't buy gasoline on this one day 
  as a boycott.  The reasoning seemed stupid.  I don't think even we 
  pay that much for gasoline.  At least relatively.  We pay $1.50 at 
  the most?  I know India pays a lot more.  Yet in most situation 
  bottled water costs more.  We never complain about the price of Evian.  
  So yeah, I don't think that there are that many people on the Internet 
  who will be persuaded enough to not buy gas if they currently buy gas 
  on a daily basis.  The reality of the matter is people don't need to 
  drive that much.  I know this, because I don't drive at all.  There are 
  specific cases where driving is a necessity but Personal Rapid Transit 
  is a real cool idea and just might work:)
  <p>Being a math major is cool.  Like after a brief training in formal 
  logic I feel that everything that people do must have some logic behind 
  it to be worthy.  Logic just gets rid of doing stupid things.  Of course 
  I don't always do logical things.  Like sometimes I type TTTTTTT over and 
  over TTTTTT in the midTTTTdle of words too.
  <p>
  This weekend seems longer than most.  <a href="http://umn.edu/~hugh0083/">
  Scott Hughes</a> visited Friday.  I talked with Caroline early Saturday morning.  
  I saw <i>Heathers</i> (which is a whacked movie).  I did homework.  Well it 
  seems like I had an extra day somewhere.
  <p>A lot of people have really bad study habbits.  Like they can't 
  concentrate for long periods of time.  These are the same people who study 
  with the TV on.  Which doesn't make sense, I mean, your mind only wants 
  to deal with one stream of information at a time.  Well that is if you 
  are focussed.
  <p>Here is a joke from <a href="http://www.cgi-resources.com">Matt</a>'s roommate, Jawed.
  <blockquote><tt>Q. How are you supposed to pronounce ether?  E-THer or eth-er?
  <br>A. Either.
  </tt></blockquote>
  Best Joke I heard in a long time.
  <p>Note: I plan on rewriting the journal interface once more.  It has a lot of 
  internal problems that I dislike.  That and pair Networks recommends it:)
