Katie, Lil' T, engelbot, Marc, Erin and I went to Suzy's parent's St. Patty's day party.

It was a blast!  Never been to a St. Patrick's day party before, but it was fun, especially when Suzy's dad and Suzy's uncles sang <a href="http://www.local.ie/content/20357.shtml/music/traditional_music/ballads">Merry Ploughboy</a> (with a few added lines).
