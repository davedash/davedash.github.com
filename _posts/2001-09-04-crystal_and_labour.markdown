title: Crystal and Labour
excerpt: |-
  Labor Day weekend.  Not entirely eventful.  My mom, however, will be getting an almost new Volvo S80.  A wonderful vehicle with amazingly comfortable seats.  I can't wait to come back to MN.  My brother is removing the shingles from the side of his house and replacing it with stucco.  It should look nice when I get back.  Funny... all these cool things just begin when I get back... oh well.
  <p>I'm actually looking forward to work today.  I should stop typing this and go:)</p>
