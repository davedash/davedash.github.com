title: Day 21 No Molly (Monday)
excerpt: "I should have taken those phone calls last night with a bit more concern as I later found out today.\r\n\
  <p>\r\n\
  On to something less morose.  My cousins and family are in town.  My nephew was playing with Voltron.  I started packing one box so far.  Unfortunately most of my packing will take place later this week.  Maybe a laptop wouldn't be such a bad idea.\r\n\
  <p>\r\n\
  Marc came over.  We ate and watched <i>Freakazoid!</i>  Daniel Lavenda came and we went to baseball at Anna's.  That was a lot of fun.  Daniel and I were playing around with my depth perception.  Apparantly I don't use it and rely soley on visual cues or something.\r\n\
  <p>\r\n\
  After the game Daniel and I picked up a French movie called <i>The Visitor</i> featuring Jean Reno (from <i>The Professional</i> and more recently <i>Godzilla</i>) and we got some food and pop.  This was a hilarious movie and that's from subtitles.  The guy says \"okaaaaay\" like Marc says \"aaaaay.\"\r\n\
  <p>I guess tomorrow (or today) Katie, Daniel and perhaps Marc are coming over to watch <i>Freakazoid!</i>  Katie doesn't seem like the type that would come over soley for Television.  I think maybe it's because she wants to spend \"quality time\" with her Alter-ego... "
