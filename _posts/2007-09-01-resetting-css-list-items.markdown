Call me a purist, but I really believe that Blueprint should go the extra step as YUI (note: I'm a YUI CSS user dabbling in Blueprint) does and reset list items as well.  It's all about how you use your elements and what you consider as resetting, but I feel that a bullet added to a list is something that should be removed in a proper reset.css file.

Different browsers are going to have their own ways of rendering bullets and really the developer should explicitly inform us how they would like their lists rendered.

Personally, most of my list items are lists of links as in menus, which require no bullets usually.  This is probably the source of my bias.
