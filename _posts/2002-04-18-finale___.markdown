title: Finale...
excerpt: |
  Finished... for now.  Yesterday we had our big rally of over a hundred.  It was well coordinated.  It's our finale for the year.  I hope that people remain active about this.  I think they will.  Shafaq might need to be cloned, but I'm sure others will lead the movement.

Finished... for now.  Yesterday we had our big rally of over a hundred.  It was well coordinated.  It's our finale for the year.  I hope that people remain active about this.  I think they will.  Shafaq might need to be cloned, but I'm sure others will lead the movement.
<!--more-->Soon I will start the miraculous journey where I discover what I'm doing with my life.  I hope that I can do more to extend the freedoms and the human dignity of all people.
I think I'll be safe.  I won't be alone in this game.  I've got my naya parivar, new family.  Working together for so long that's what we've become.  As far as I get in Minneapolis or elsewhere, the Heart of Darkness, Champaign-Urbana, will be my home.  
Perhaps I will be lured to Chicago.  Perhaps that will become my new home in time.  We'll see how far the Minneapolis-plan gets me...
