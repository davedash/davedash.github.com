excerpt: I was reading the current issue of <a href="http://www.bootnet.com/">Boot magazine</a>.  It had an interview with an Ogawa-san from <a href="http://www.sony.com/">Sony</a>.  Boot asked him about integrating the MiniDisc with the VAIO computers.  He said that the possibility of using the MiniDisc as a storage medium is available (but he didn't make it seem likely).<p>I came up with an idea.  If a company wants to make their replacement for the floppy the medium it has to do two things:<ol><li>Store over 100 megs of data.<li>Be backwards compatible somehow with old floppy drives.</ol>You may be thinking, yeah didn't Imation try that?  Yes, they did.  The backwards compatability shouldn't be a restriction to the design of the new device.  All you need to do is stick a slot and have two different readers.  One reading old floppies, one reading new disks.  The other problem Imation had was marketing.  Everyone has this problem, Iomega is probably the only company that is doing this marginally well.  The best way to market these devices is to mass produce a large quantity of them and give them away to major PC manufacturers and sell them for a very low price to smaller OEMs.  They can make the money back later by selling disks and backup software, etc.<p>This of course is a longterm solution.  American companies do not use long term solutions.  Japanese companies do.<p>My brother was telling me about a hybrid vehicle from Toyota.  Toyota sells these vehicles in Japan for half the price that it costs them to make these vehicles.<p>Why?<p>Why would you buy a hybrid vehicle if it costs a lot more than an "equal" gasoline car?  By doing this, people will buy the vehicles.  Common people who don't by the latest eco-friendly machines.  When you have a large customer base, you can mass produce more vehicles.  Thus cutting costs.  You can also build other models of hybrid cars which would let you do part-sharing between models, which lowers the cost of building these vehicles much more.  In a decade or two, you will now have a population that drives ecologically sound vehicles and you will be selling these vehicles for profit.  I think however, Toyota was doing this primarily to help "save the earth."

I was reading the current issue of <a href="http://www.bootnet.com/">Boot magazine</a>.  It had an interview with an Ogawa-san from <a href="http://www.sony.com/">Sony</a>.

I came up with an idea.  If a company wants to make their replacement for the floppy the medium it has to do two things:

1. Store over 100 megs of data.
2. Be backwards compatible somehow with old floppy drives.

You may be thinking, yeah didn't Imation try that?  Yes, they did.  The backwards compatability shouldn't be a restriction to the design of the new device.  All you need to do is stick a slot and have two different readers.  One reading old floppies, one reading new disks.  The other problem Imation had was marketing.  Everyone has this problem, Iomega is probably the only company that is doing this marginally well.  The best way to market these devices is to mass produce a large quantity of them and give them away to major PC manufacturers and sell them for a very low price to smaller OEMs.  They can make the money back later by selling disks and backup software, etc.

This of course is a longterm solution.  American companies do not use long term solutions.  Japanese companies do.

My brother was telling me about a hybrid vehicle from Toyota.  Toyota sells these vehicles in Japan for half the price that it costs them to make these vehicles.

Why?

Why would you buy a hybrid vehicle if it costs a lot more than an "equal" gasoline car?  By doing this, people will buy the vehicles.  Common people who don't by the latest eco-friendly machines.  When you have a large customer base, you can mass produce more vehicles.  Thus cutting costs.  You can also build other models of hybrid cars which would let you do part-sharing between models, which lowers the cost of building these vehicles much more.
