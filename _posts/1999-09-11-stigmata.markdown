excerpt: |
  Yesterday was awesome, thanks to everybody who conspired into getting me some damn good cake from Baskin Robbins.  Thanks to Matt Vagnoni for actually deciding that plain old cake isn't good enough.  The mini-party was really great.
  <P>For all of you who didn't come with me to see the midnight showing of <a href='http://www.stigmata.com/'>Stigmata</A>, it was a very good movie.  I saw it knowing only that it involved some girl getting the wounds of Christ and that's it.  I didn't see any previews or anything.  (You might say I went in on faith alone...)  Basically I wasn't expecting anything and I got a decent movie.  I won't spoil it for you further, so just see it.
  <P>After the movie <A href='http://www.mattwright.com/'>Matt Wright</A> and I went to Kristine's.  Kristine was nice enough to bake a cake for me with Anne and Ellen from the 4S Quad.  I was then kicked out of her house and forced to take the remaining cake to my dorm and even return the damn pan... anyway, all was good.
  <P>Thanks everybody, you all rule.  Speaking of rule... now that Angie, the RA, (see I mentioned your name) is gone... for the weekend, I am now in charge of 4 Center.
