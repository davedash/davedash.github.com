title: Dude, I am like so back.
excerpt: |-
  Okay, the trip back was fine.  Took a lot longer than I'd have liked, but that's just me.  Spent less than I expected I would too.
  <p>
  I've found the solution to my <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/forwindowsnt.html">relationship problems</a>... well Ryan Hayle did.  I think Molly will get it and maybe some of my friends from UI.  In fact if you are not in the subset of my friends that consists of the union of Molly and my friends from Allen Hall, just don't click on the link, you probably wouldn't figure out what the problem is.
  <p>
  I already miss Caroline and Mike and Neal... serves me right for hanging with them so much.
