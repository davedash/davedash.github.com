title: Final Shabbat?
excerpt: "So, it's Friday night... which means Shabbat.  For some orthodox Jews this means the lights go out and a lot of modern conveniences go unused.  If the Y2K bug eats everyone of those conveniences come the Millenium, that means this might be the final shabbat.  Or the really really long Shabbat that lasts forever.  "
