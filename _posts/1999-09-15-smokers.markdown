excerpt: |
  I don't have anything against smokers as people, but I think they should stop.  I mean... like the whole black lungs thing isn't working.  "Don't smoke... you'll get black lungs."  What other arguments can we give our smoking friends?  "You'll get cancer."  "You'll shorten your life span by x amount of years."
  <P>Frankly, these are threats, but they are so insignificant.  I say we change something in people or cigarettes or in the laws of physics so that when people smoke their skin starts to turn black.  Not permanently, that would just be weird, but the more you smoked the longer your skin would be black.  This way people point at you and mock you.
