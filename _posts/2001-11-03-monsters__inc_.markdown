title: Monsters, Inc.
excerpt: Normally I go into movies with low expectations - not with Monster's Inc.  <a href="http://www.pixar.com/">Pixar</a> has always delivered wonderful movies and this is of course no exception.  It was nice to see my brother's high school friend, Peter Docter, as the first person mentioned in credits.  Great direction!.  We were lucky to see as a bonus a trailer for Episode II.  Yay!
