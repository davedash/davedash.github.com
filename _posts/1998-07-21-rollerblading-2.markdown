title: Rollerblading
excerpt: Yesterday I went Rollerblading with the kids.  It was my first time.  I am not very good at Rollerblading, but would like to get better.  I am thinking of buying some blades and then practicing in my garage until I can navigate normally.  Then I'll use them as a means of transportation.  Or, I could not do that and walk.  Some of the kids tried to help me.  That was nice of them.  I pitted Marc's kids against Marc.<p>Today, however, at Valleyfair Marc's kids were turned against me.  Well some of them.  I didn't care that much.  We went on a lot of rides and had a moderate ammount of fun.  I have no idea about tomorrow's trip to Valley Fair.<p><a href="http://www.borchert.com/tom/">Tom's web page</a> is really funny.  Like you find out about all the games Tom plays.
