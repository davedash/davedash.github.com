excerpt: |-
  I just came back from the Inquiry meeting at Purdue University.  I 
  must say I am jealous.  The campus is beautiful compared to the 
  <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/">U of I</a>.  The buildings were closer to each other
  and where there were open spaces there were water fountains and circular
  paths rather than quadrangles and diagonal paths every which where.
  Also, the Education School gets real money, unklike ours.  I got to see 
  the Liberal Arts and Education Building which was newly built in '94.
  Very nice.  It had several computer labs that were phenomenal top of the 
  line computer labs that were all run by the Education Technology group.
  <p>The other members of the Inquiry group, including my professor, were 
  great people to hang out with.  We rode in our professor's Volkswagen van
  and had interesting conversations about computing, robots, 10-10-626 
  among other things.  I wouldn't mind visiting again.
