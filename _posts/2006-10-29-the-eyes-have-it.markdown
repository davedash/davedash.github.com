For most of my adult life, I have had terrible vision in my left eye (the one affected by congenital ptosis).  The "1-2" test that doctors and nurses have given me have always been a frustration.  "1-2" what does it matter if I can barely read the third largest line on the eye chart.

I've been seeing the same eye doctor twice a year for a few years, and finally I asked, what can I do to improve my vision in the left eye.  It's a simple question, but for some reason, it needed to be asked before something was to happen.

We did a much better "1-2" test where things didn't just go from blurry to blurry, but from blurry, to "oh my God, I can read."  He wrote me a prescription that brought me up from 20/100 to 20/25.  This is like a total upgrade to my life.

In the next week or two, my intent is to exchange my lenses at [America's Best](http://twopair.com) and try out my new vision.  I'm very excited.
