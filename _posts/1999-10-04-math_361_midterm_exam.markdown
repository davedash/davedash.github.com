title: Math 361 Midterm Exam
excerpt: |-
  I had my first Midterm Exam in Math 361.  It was exceptionally easy.  I got a maximum of 20% wrong (one 20% problem wrong, unsure about partial credit).  I do fear that the exams following this will be significantly more difficult.  Matt Wright (although he probably didn't use these words) said, "Sure... the first test they give you is easy.  That's just to get you hooked.  After that... that's when they nail you... right in the ear."
  <P>I've got an Econ 102 exam tomorrow.  It should be easy, but I think I'll study with Cindy who crams for all her tests.
