title: Effective arguments
excerpt: I see this happening within my group of friends.  What tends to happen, is they will do something.  Some type of authority will tell them to stop and their best argument is that what they are doing is some type of alternative to 'typical' behavior, like drinking, etc.  You can look at any action in this way and justify a lot of stuff.  Let's say somebody annoys me.  I could antagonize them and justify this by saying, well it's better than killing them.  These types of arguments do not work.  For example, Tag is not an alternative to drinking beer.  Holding discussions in prohibitted areas is not an alternative to doing drugs.  If you want people to give you any credibility, do not always think of your actions as an alternative to something.  If someone says you shouldn't play tag, don't just complain how you are "at least not getting drunk."  Try to come up with some type of rational argument and say that if anything.  The truth is a park ranger would probably rather have you drinking beer somewhere just because his job is to keep the park safe for children (even if there are no children around) not to prevent underage drinking.
