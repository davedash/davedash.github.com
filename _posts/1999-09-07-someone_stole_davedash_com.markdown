excerpt: |-
  If you couldn't connect earlier today to davedash.com it was due to some technical difficulties.  Like these aliens came down in a spaceship and stole davedash.com, okay?  That's pretty technical, eh?
  <P>Thanks to <A HREF='http://www.uiuc.edu/~sdhughes/'>Scott Hughes</A> who noticed this.
