title: No Molly Day 5
excerpt: |-
  Today (or well yesterday) I went to <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com">Best Buy</a> with <a href="http://www.engelbot.com/">Adam</a> and Marc.  I bought volumes one and two of the <a href="http://www.maverickrc.com/weddingsinger/">Wedding Singer soundtrack</a>.  It is very very good!  It's also infinitely easier than finding the MP3s for the songs.<p>
  Marc and I watched <i>Conspiracy Theory</i>  It was an okay movie.  It was pretty interesting.  It featured Mel Gibson and Patrick Stewart.  If you have HBO, it's worth catching.
  
  <p>Tomorrow I guess the plan is to stalk the band They Might be Giants at the <a href="http://twincities.sidewalk.com/detail/44146">First Annual Hops Festival</a>.  We'll attempt to listen to them for free by not going to the actual festival, but by being right outside it.  This way Marc won't booze-up with a festival full of drinking buddies.
