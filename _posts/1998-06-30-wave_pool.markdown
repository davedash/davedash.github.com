title: Wave Pool
excerpt: I Sunday I went to the Wave Pool with <a href="http://www.engelbot.com/">Adam</a>, <a href="mailto:laureen@ftmax.com">Laureen</a>, Kit, <a href="mailto:jhsung@mit.edu">Jenwa</a>, Kerry and Ben Schack.  It was a lot of fun, albeit the $6 admission + $2/2hour increments for the tubes was a little much.<p>Afterwards we (well all of us besides Kit) went to Good Earth.  Unfortunately I went with Molly and her parents to the Good Earth in the Galleria on Saturday.  It was fun none the less.  We had a nice waitress and gave her a large tip and a children's menu that was all colored.<p>The whole day was very very fun.  It was one of those days that made summer and friends seem enjoyable.<p>This week Molly and I work at the ITCEP/UMTYMP office.  Doing inventory and stuff.  It's pretty dull, but it is a nice environment.  I found a few files from the Summer Institute I attended.  That was cool.  Today <a href="katie@ftmax.com">Katie</a> came over to email people about something at Orchestra Hall featuring women composers on Thursday 16 July.<p>Hopefully I'll finish most of the Thank You cards tonight.  Yesterday I asked my mom about the cards I had trouble with.  Tomorrow I'm going to a wedding and Thursday morning I will for my first time fly to California.  I come back Sunday and leave again on Monday for UIUC.
