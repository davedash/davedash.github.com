title: Live Forever!
excerpt: "<a href=\"http://www.union.uiuc.edu/iub/lecture/bradbury/\">Ray Bradbury</a>'s (he's older looking in real life) lecture at Foellinger Auditorium was the most motivational thing to which I have ever gone.  His lecture was mostly his childhood and about his interests.  He spoke of how it was his desires and love for the things he did that got him where he was.  I won't detail to much of the event here, as he spoke of a lot of things.  I was so tempted to run after the car that drove him from Foellinger to wherever he needed to be.  He had a few good lines, \"Find something that makes you hyperventilate and scares your friends.\"  \"Find something you really love and find a girl who can stand you.\"  He was a real advocate of doing things that you loved and doing it for the rest of your life.  He did announce a few things.  <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Title?Fahrenheit+451+(2000)\">Farenheit 451</a> featuring my favorite actor, Mel Gibson, is due this January or February (IMDB says something different, however).  He also said next year to look out for a redone <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Title?Martian+Chronicles,+The+(1998)\">Martian Chronicles</a>.  He said the original is too boring.  He talked about the endings he redid for a bunch of movies.  He'd watch a movie, hate the ending, and then he'd rewrite the end to make it better.  I love that.  He wrote, because he loved to write.  What a cool guy.  He's inspired me to write.  Something, anything.  I've always loved the future and robots, so I'll write about that - regardless if it is crappy.  I now want to go buy Legos.  I love Legos.  I love making my own little universe of the future using Legos.  It's the funnest thing in the world.<p>\r\n\
  Oh yeah, umm... PS.  He still writes books.  He's in the middle of four right now.  "
