title: All saints day...
excerpt: |
  Meijer is really annoying.  They often change their prices every week, thus causing confusion on how much you are paying.  Like I paid almost $8 for a 24 pack of Lipton - almost as bad as a vending machine, but not quite.  Yesterday Mike (my neighbor) and I went to Meijer, and since I was there I felt compelled to buy something.  So I bought a some Frappuccino, I ended up paying $4.80.  WTF.  Meijer also doesn't price all their products on the shelves.  That's the most annoying thing in the world.  Of course, I wasn't doing my part in asking for a price check, but really, $1.20 for some fancy yuppie drink?  You've got to be kidding me.  I may have to go shop at Target for more stuff.
  <p>
  Mike and I noticed a Perpetual Dawn (sorry, it's a song from Orb) yesterday.  It looked like it was 6AM, 7AM and then 7PM at various periods during the day.  In otherwords, no day yesterday.  No day today either, although I was never outside.  It has been cold, but I have to tolerate it.  I think Jack starts to smell after some time in the morning, so I keep my window open and my door open to bring fresh air into the room.<p>
  <img height=207 width=196 src=http://www.ftmax.com/images/flockhart.jpg align=left>If you step into my hall you can smell the boo-puke left by somebody who didn't know his boo-beer tolerance this Halloween.  Drinking to the point that you are going to vomit is stupid.  Vomiting in the hallway is stupid.  Stupidity doesn't belong in Allen Hall.
  <p>
  I guess my neighbor had a talk with Jack and pointed out that we don't get along.  Jack and I had a talk.  I hate having talks with Jack.  I mean, I don't mind talking to Jack, but addressing issues is really annoying.  Mainly because it deals with a lot of judgement.  I suppose it's something I should get used to.  I guess both of us just get "pissed-off" at each other and need to tell each other when this occurs.  I suppose it's a good thing.  I went into this whole roommate business negatively to begin with.  I will still make fun of Jack and post updates that are demeaning, because Jack is wierd.  He admits it.  I am also going to have to find a clever way of recording him on my computer, Cooledit is too big.  Okay, I just found some shortcuts... :)
  <p>
  Laurel Prussing When asked to indicate which principles she supports concerning education in a survey from <a href="http://www.vote-smart.org/">Project Votesmart</a> said, "Give children vouchers to choose their parents."  Perhaps a typo, I like it anyway.  I decided instead of seeing whether I like Ewing or Prussing (for House of Representatives) to screw it.  My vote goes to Prussing, because she seems like she'll support the things I like.  I'll make up my own arguments for not choosing Ewing.  "Ewing is the demon-seed spawn of the devil.  His last term in congress brought the devil one step closer to taking away everything in which you believe.  This Novermber when you vote, don't vote for evil, vote for non-evil, vote for Laurel Prusssing.  Laurel Prussing lets kids choose their parents."<p>
  Sounds like India has it's own "religious right," known as the Vidya Bharati, making educational demands.  
  They want to ban certain poems and stories.  Schools shouldn't teach the young "graphically about the female body and her emotions."
  <p>Our school has this cool thing.  Let's say you are going to a web site.  If it's busy or down or just hard to connect to, this webcache system (128.174.0.245 or webcache.gw.uiuc.edu) takes up the task of trying to connect to the site for you (I'm assuming that's it's only task, so it's faster).  I also think that it just serves you frequently vistied pages.  So if you go to Yahoo, and someone else does, it's their right away, and the webcache thing just gives you what it has.  That is kick-ass.
  <p><b>Little things</b><ul><li>
  Today we can celebrate the fall of the Ottoman Empire (1922).
  <li>Jack got a "Yo Quiero Taco Bell" poster Friday and put it up 
  Saturday.  It's scary.<li>
  I've cleaned up my new "better-than Adam's loft" desk.  There;s a lot of space to work with.  Of course that space may change in a week or two.
