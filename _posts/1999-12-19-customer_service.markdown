title: Customer Service
excerpt: |-
  I have no finals, so I can complain.  Notice the blatant lack of customer service in any field?  Hospital... assholes.  Fast food... assholes.  Banks... assholes.  Hotels... assholes.  I swear to god, everybody's got this asshole attitude in every industry.  I think for this reason the Internet commerce will trive and will force people to be more and more reluctant to have person to person contact with strangers.  I'm going to have to put a stop to this.
  <P>On the lighter side of things, people have been emailing me some funny crap.  I'll post it somewhere, worth a read.  Really in-depth stuff... funny... very funny.
