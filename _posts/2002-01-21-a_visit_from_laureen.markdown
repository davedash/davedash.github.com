title: A visit from Laureen
excerpt: I'm still going to win over my classes... but it looks like it needs from effort.  In more interesting news Laureen (a.k.a. the Hero) came by Urbana this weekend.  A visit in this seemingly God-forsaken wasteland is always nice.

I'm still going to win over my classes... but it looks like it needs from effort.  In more interesting news Laureen (a.k.a. the Hero) came by Urbana this weekend.  A visit in this seemingly God-forsaken wasteland is always nice.<!--more-->Laureen had several interviews for the Med/PhD program here at UIUC.  My friends, yesterday, kidnapped her and took her to Chicagoland.  So that's the end of her.

In other news I just had the most twisted dream... and it took me an hour after waking up to establish that none of it was real.  Apparently some tests were being done and it was thought that I might have anthrax (the disease, not the band).  I guess the deal was that I was to fly out to some lab somewhere for a weekend and they would deanthracize me (with any luck).  That was scary.
