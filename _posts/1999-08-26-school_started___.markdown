title: School started...
excerpt: |-
  Pretty much everyone's moved into Allen Hall.  School started yesterday.  I was also sicker than a dog for the last few days.  The eye decided to go evil on me and is very swollen.  My cold is on it's way out too.
  <P>Angie, my RA, decided to check out my page:O  I'll update it soon.  I'm going to start scanning pictures when I hold lab hours for my job.  I'll also bring the DaveCam back online soon.  If I get a lot of spare time I'll make it do cool tricks.
  <P>By the way, if anybody has Moby's <I>Play</I> CD, lemme know.
