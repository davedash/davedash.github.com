Raj came down yesterday and we wasted our time in Chicago walking all over town doing nothing and then eventually going to the Queensryche concert.  Too bad the concert was not that great.  

The sound was horrible, it was hard to hear Geoff Tate's voice.  The stage props were poorly designed as well.  They did have the technology to replicate what they had done in some of their previous tours (which were excellent, *Promised Land* and *Sign of the Times* tours.

They did manage to play a good selection of songs from *Operation: Mindcrime* but traded singing some of their better songs from *Empire* and *Promised Land* for their newer experiments.    Although I like them because the experiment with music, their new stuff does not cut it.  Still, worth the price of admission, especially since I got comps for tonights show.
