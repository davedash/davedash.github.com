Tom Segev (op-ed writer for Ha'aretz) delves into the relationship between the Holocaust and the modern Israeli state.

Of course... that's not saying much, I enjoy most of what I read.  This, however, helped fill historical gaps and gave a sociological insight into attitudes in Israel toward survivors, the &quot;Oriental Jews,&quot; the Palestinians, and the Jewish diaspora.

To one extent - it is a battle between the Jew and the Israeli.  The Jews are a persecuted people.  The survivors were the so-called &quot;last Jews.&quot;  This came into conflict with the Israeli, the new man, the pioneer of the Jewish homeland.

The greater, in my opinion, tragedy mentioned is the &quot;political football&quot; which was played with the Holocaust.  It was not appreciated by many of the survivors and certainly cheapened the tragedy.

This book gives tremendous insight into a lot of the motivation behind Israeli actions.  The book brings us into the mid 90s so it does discuss a lot of things that we would see today if we were to go to Israel or Occupied Palestine.
