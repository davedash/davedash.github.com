About a month back I hit a milestone, I went down to my pre-California weight.

Here's a chart of my weight since August 2007, a few months before I moved to
California.

Here are the events:

<ol class="ualpha">
    <li>Move from Minneapolis to SF Bay</li>
    <li>Visit Minneapolis</li>
    <li>Visit Minneapolis</li>
    <li>Leaving Yahoo!</li>
    <li>Move to San Jos√©</li>
    <li>Try iChange</li>
</ol>

### The Basics

There's nothing shocking.  The more I ate and less I exercised, the more I
gained weight.  Travel was an easy way to gain weight because I never checked
in regularly.  Moving to a condo with an awesome gym made regular exercise a
breeze.

I tried out [iChange][] which offered one-on-one monitoring.  That got me
eating healthier food, so it put most of my calories to good use:

*   Sugar and saturated fats were all but eliminated from my diet and slowly
    reintroduced when I could moderate them.
*   Counting calories helped reset my internal calorie tracker.  I still don't
    do it enough, so I try to simply eat better.
*   Water tastes better the more I drink it.  I drink a lot of soda still, but
    there are days when I can completely avoid it.
*   Exercising a lot is nice.  I get to eat more.  Exercising early works best
    for me.
*   Eating more whole grains felt better.  The food was flavorful.
*   Balanced meals were tricky, though eating more fruit and vegetables made me
    less hungry for higher calorie items.
*   I had to start by doing *everything*: eating better, exercising, etc.
    Doing one thing at a time was a failure.  There were no shortcuts at the
    beginning.

Now I stay pretty much on track with losing weight.  The days I gain a bit of
weight, I understand why, and I am usually able to resolve it quickly.
Therefore weight loss is no longer stressful.

So with about 10lbs less of weight from the beginning of this year, I can sling
on a Moby-wrap with my son (when he decides to be born) and it'll feel like
nothing.
