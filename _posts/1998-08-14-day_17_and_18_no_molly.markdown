title: Day 17 and 18 No Molly
excerpt: I got most of my shopping done for Urbana.  Now my problem is getting there.  I have to talk them into letting me in early or I have to get there by 9AM on Saturday or maybe something magical will happen and I can go whenever.  Hopefully tonight my brother will give me a schedule to work around.  Looks like all the good computers at <a href="http://www.micronpc.com/">Micron's</a> refurbished division are being purchased as they are added.  Oh well.<p>The Hindu Mandir email thing is coming along.  Now I am working on how the sign up form works.  It's a long form because it's collecting data for the Bulliten Board as well.<p>Want to see something cool?  Check <a href="http://www.kryotech.com/">this</a> out.
