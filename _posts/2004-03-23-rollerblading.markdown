 and I went Rollerblading.  I'm glad the winds been slowly dying down and the streets/sidewalks around town are clear enough to skate.

I like skating a lot.  It's relaxing and I get a sense of freedom.  We went around Uptown... which seems to have been built for skating.

I also enjoy hanging out with Marc and just being as ... well just being the way we are when we're together.

I Rollerblade whenever it's half-way decent out, so if anybody wants to go let me know.  I usually go around the lakes in Minneapolis.
