title: Penchant to anger
excerpt: So it would appear that I have an unconscious penchant to anger people... well not really.  I don't do that intentionally.  It also seems lately that I've been more irritable as of late as well.  These two things aren't unrelated.  I think I just need to buckle down and deal with all those things that cause me immediate worry.

So it would appear that I have an unconscious penchant to anger people... well not really.  I don't do that intentionally.  It also seems lately that I've been more irritable as of late as well.  These two things aren't unrelated.  I think I just need to buckle down and deal with all those things that cause me immediate worry.<!--more-->I wish I was like a turtle.  I could then retreat into my shell and the world around me can do whatever it wants to and I need not be a part of it.  I would be a tiny stone that just sits in a garden doing nothing... just lying their peacefully.  Then one day I'd crawl out of that shell and move along to whatever.

If I taught my self ninjitsu I could become a ninja turtle.  I could teach myself by mimicking real ninjas... not that I see any, but I could find some.  Then I could wear a ninja costume.  I'd have a katana in a sheath that rests on my back. . . or rather my shell.  Wait, I could just be a ninja... and a poet, using the same costume... time to take on the world...
