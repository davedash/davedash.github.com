  Whopping out my schedule...<p>
  Day 1:<br>I ate breakfast.  It was bad.  I went to take tests.  I did unusually well.  I am normally nervous during tests and do very very average.  Then we went to the Kranner Center for the opening ceremonies.  Krannert Center is a Transformer.  It turns into a giant monster and eats families.  It follows the quota system.  The rest of the day was mediocre.  The campus issues at the Krannert Center was reminiscint of High School politically correct skits.  We had ones on getting drunk, getting raped, getting assaulted and getting a lesbian roommate that is black.  Afterwards the kids got to discuss this and make posters.  Very High School like.<p>Day 2<br>This was the good day because it went fast.  Breakfast was okay, they have waffle irons there.  The Personal Safety issues sucked and I left when they started to talk about the World Wide Web (wasn't safetry related... but...).  I went to some success oriented things and then... hmm I went to a special interest session on Unit one/Allen Hall which is my dorm this fall.  That was cool.  Helped me as far as signing up for classes goes.  Then I ate lunch and then got my ID card... (I look like a dork) and then signed up for classes.  My schedule is:<pre>
  Comparative Literature of Non-Western Civilization
  Intro to CS
  Chemistry
  What is College
  Graph Theory
  hopefully more...
  </pre>
  <p>Umm then I went home.<p>Oh yeah, I've e-dopted Sunita as my e-sister.  She's cool.
