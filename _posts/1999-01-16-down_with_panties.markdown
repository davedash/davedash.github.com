title: Down with panties!
excerpt: |
  Sorry, the last title was from the Simpsons, and this seemed to fit.  Hey, I don't have to appologize.  I live in a country where we can destroy other countries!  Like this incident in <a href="http://www.22online.com/199901/14/brief1.html">Jamaica</a>.  The truth is, this is just a really bad post as far as you know... I say "breasts" a few time in this one, so I think you should avoid it.  I don't usually say "breasts" so you can be rest assured that it's unlikely the next post will contain that word.  In fact, if you are good at statistics or are just really bored, you can calculate the probability using a simple abacus or brain.
  
  <p>Oh, I almost forgot.  <i>This Hour has 22 Minutes</i> featured a segment called "Talking to Americans."  Where they videotaped us being stupid.  It was quite funny.  They were making fun of all these misconceptions that Americans have of Canada and they were making fun of the Governor of Arkansas.  Once clip they asked an amazing replica of Pat Borchert whether she thought that the Governor of Arkansas was educated.  Adam and I continue to wonder if this was the actual Pat Borchert.  If it is, that's pretty cool.  If not, look out for the clones.
  
  <p>I've always thought people who talk to plants are wierd.  I just told my mom to talk to a plant.  My Molly talks to her cat.  That's why her cat stays home, so she can't talk to it so much.
  
  <p><a href="http://cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9901/14/india.stampede/">This</a> is a bunch of Indians that were just to much for a tiny hill.  This shoudln't amuse me, but it does.  It's that harsh bitter ironic amusement though.  As if I was God, laughing at people.  Anyway, during the 40 days of abstinance I wonder if kids who are born nine months later are shunned by celebrators of Makar Sankranti.  All India needs is a few more holidays like this and the population rate can be cut severely.
  
  <p>Finally, a <a href="http://customnews.cnn.com/cnews/pna.show_story?p_art_id=3330404&p_section_name=U.S.">burglar with class</a>.
  
  <p>Who'd of thought the BBC would be so fun-filled?  Well here's a scoop on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_254000/254621.stm"> typing using your mind</a>
  
  <p>Update on my class situation... I have been un "Kay"-ed.  Turns out CS 3321 at the U of M satisfies the requirement for CS 125.  So here's my schedule:
  
  <p>Reading Spiderman action books (I just added the word action, it's pretty cool) is pretty neat.  Spiderman's wife Mary Jane is so cool.  I mean, she has bright red unnatural hair... well of course it's up to interpretation, but the TV show and the comic books show it as red.  Of couse the book has a character who referred to it as carrotty.  Carrotty like Carrot top.  
  
  <p>Today (Friday) I went to Wirth Park and went sledding, it was fun.  I think I will purchase a sled for the next time I partake in sledding.  I was with Daniel Lavenda (makes puns) and Dan Fisher (makes people sail).  We did not successfully meet up with Hackel.  Later when we finished we met with Hackel and went to Perkins.  I think I saw someone else their who I recognized... someone... INDIAN (play Indian music in the background for a few minutes).  I said nothing, because I wasn't sure.  After Perkins we decided to see a movie.  Dan Fisher and I forced <i>Can't Hardly Wait</i> on people.  That's a good movie.  Watch it.  Well no, don't watch it, but it is a decent movie.  What made it a plus is it had Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Except she looked damn hungry.  I wanted to reach out and give her a hamburger, even though I myself don't eat beef.  So now I have one movie down of hers and approximately ten more movies which actually I may not want to see.  Here's something neat.  She's only a few months older than me and was born in Waco, TX.  I don't understand why people like her so much.  22online.com seems to say it's the breasts, but I think that's stupid.  I think she's cool because she looks pretty and her name is "Love."  So whenever someone says Love, I can say, "Hewitt?"
  
  <p>BTW, I need calcium.  My left elbow feels funny, so I'm going to drink Rice Dream instead of Cherry Coke or whatever body degrading drinks I drink.  Speaking of drinking, one of the reasons I thought <i>Can't Hardly Wait</i> might be a decent movie to see, is that way I can get a view of what normal people may have done at a party at the end of the year.  I decided the only thing that I really missed from my school experience was how long people were friends.  Since I moved from Bloomington, I knew people I graduated with for about four or five years.  What I didn't get was the, "Remember in fourth grade..."  I miss that.  Right now the only people I talk to that I met before fourth grade summer is a girl that I knew since before school until first grade and a close friend that I knew for half of seventh grade.  My closest friend now (who's name rhyme's with Trolly, laugh with me people) is fortunate to still be friends with someone from her early childhood.  Same goes for a lot of the people I know, who've "known people for so long."  I miss that.  I don't need it though, that's what's good.  I just keep thinking, when life throws me a lemon, lemons aren't all bad.
