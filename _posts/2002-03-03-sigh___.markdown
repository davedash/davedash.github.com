My intent to focus only on Palestine/Israel has failed.  India had 500 deaths.  Mostly retaliation against Muslims in general.  This involved the burning of bodies of men, women and children.  This disgusting manifestation of Hindutva and its ideal to drive Muslims "back to Pakistan" is the most cruel and backwards racism I've heard of in a long time.<p>Meanwhile, Palestine and Israel is a growing mess of reactionaries.</p><p>Why does life get harder and harder...</p>
