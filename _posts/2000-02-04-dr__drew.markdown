excerpt: |-
  One of my favorite shows is Loveline which is actually a radio show.  Dr. Drew from this show paid a visit to our campus today and just gave us a very interesting talk and q&a session.  Very amusing and a very interesting person.
  <P>
  A bit of good news... I now work for NCSA as a undergraduate web developer.  It's a bit of a pay raise from my current job.  I'll hold both for a while, I think.
