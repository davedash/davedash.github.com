  Saw <A HREF='http://www.engelbot.com/'>Adam</A> yesterday while he was here for College Bowl.
  <P>Last night I went wall climbing at Vertical Plains.  That was a lot of fun.  I think over Thanksgiving Break I'll try to plan a small wall climbing trip if enough people are interested (it'll be either Friday morning or Saturday).
