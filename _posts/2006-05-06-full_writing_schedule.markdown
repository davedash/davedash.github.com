title: Full writing schedule
excerpt: |-
  I've created a full writing schedule for this site for the next year.  These include various tutorials on usability, [symfony], <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym>, [Google Maps][g], <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> and other web development related issues.  These, of course, will be in addition to the periodic updates to [reviewsby.us][r].  Stay tuned.  I should be releasing them at least once a month.
