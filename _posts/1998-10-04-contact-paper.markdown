title: Contact paper
excerpt: Contact paper is neat.  I bought a roll from <a href="http://www.meijer.com">Meijer's</a> and covered most of the front of my door with it.  I think I will cover the back of the door later.  The nice thing is that it's open doors on Tuesday so my door will look pretty.  I think Frank Herbert has really neat ideas about leadership.  I shall strive to be more like his ideal (Leto Atreides I).
