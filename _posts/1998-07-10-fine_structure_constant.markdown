title: Fine Structure Constant
excerpt: Can somebody explain to me the Fine Structure Constant?<p>Anyway.  I'm sick of something.  Trends.  There's all these people who will follow trends without understanding them.  Like the Internet.  Like 137 FSC, etc.  But more the Internet.  People should like learn about things before thinking they are neat.  Why is it that half the people on the Internet haven't the slightest clue on how to do anything.  We have computer illiterate people surfing the web.  It's like the problem with illiterate people graduating from high school.  I hate that.  I'm going to start writing these Internet things for people that explain to them how to do everything I can do.  Well almost everything.  I'm going to work on my site tonight.
