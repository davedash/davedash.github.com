  I'm very confused... Diwali was being celebrated at <a href=\"http://www.uiuc.edu/\">UI</a> Friday and will be today (Saturday).  It's being celebrated at <a href=\"http://www.stolaf.edu/\">St. Olaf</a> according to Katie.  It's also being celebrated at <a href=\"http://www.wisc.edu/\">UW</a> recently.  Diwali was a few weeks ago... very odd that it's being celebrated now.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  <p>Intel's <a href=\"http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,28330,00.html?st.ne.fd.gif.d\">new demand on the computer industry</a> is cool.  I'd say it's more comparable with the SGI O<sub>2</sub>s\r\n\
  than the iMac (as far as looks).  I think there is a more important issue at hand though.  Getting rid of old ISA technology, getting rid of 1.44MB floppy drives and getting rid of stupid ports and replacing them with USB ports.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  <p>I think the media and as many non-Minnesotans as possible should make fun of Jesse Ventura (for their own reasons, not because I say so).  The reason is this.  If Jesse is ineffective, nobody's hopes will be down.  People will just expect that.  If Jesse does succeed then people can be surprised.  I was going to continue on this train of thought, then I thought, that it may end up filling the journal systems quota.  So I wrote a more organized 'entry' and will stick it in the words section eventually.  I am only half way done.\r\n\
  <p>It snowed tonight.  I think we beat Minnesota.  "
