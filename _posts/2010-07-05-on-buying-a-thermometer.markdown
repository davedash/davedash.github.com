After talking to our doulas about thermometers, I decided it'd be best to get
an in-ear thermometer.  I didn't at first because I heard they were expensive -
but this is a device that I'll be using regularly for the foreseeable future.
Our doula has had her thermometer for 8 years.

The other thing I like about the in-ear thermometer is it takes just a few
seconds.  I'm not really into holding a thermometer in my kids bum for a few
minutes.  Holding it in their armpit is less dangerous, but still slow.  The
in-ear thermometer works in a few seconds.

It's apparently not accurate at a young age, but I'll be using this for years
to come.

I found the [Braun Thermoscan][b] at Target.  Hopefully I can resist measuring
Sibi's temperature every day.
