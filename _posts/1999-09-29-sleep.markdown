title: sleep!
excerpt: |-
  Woo!  I slept better today, I think.  I can't remember if I had a dream, but I'm sure I did.  Let's see if I can stay up before class starts (2 hrs).
  <P>Wait, I did have a dream.  It involved my parents trying to con me into joining a frat and me trying to give them reasons why I didn't want to.  It was wierd.  Cause the <A HREF='http://www.cumtd.com/'>MTD</A> came by to my house in Minnesota.  In another part of the dream Jawed and Neal were doing stuff.  I think Neal was only referred to and Jawed was like playing tennis or something.
