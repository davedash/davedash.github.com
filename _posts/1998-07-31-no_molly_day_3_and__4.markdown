title: No Molly Day 3 & 4
excerpt: |-
  Yesterday and today I woke up at 9:46AM.  I don't know why I wake up at that time, I just do.  Yesterday I did nothing useful.  Well I actually mailed the last of my thank you notes.  I read <i>Dune</i> a lot too.  Suzy stopped by and gave me a CD.  This is what I call human contact.  I think it was neat.  She showed me some shirts for her parent's company.<p>
  Today I recieved a 9.1 GB Hard Drive as mentioned earlier.  I have nothing but good news to report about it.  This is the first time I've ever had to install a hard drive and I am very glad I decided to get a SCSI drive because they are easier than Jell-o to install.  I was going to read the online installation guide at <a href="http://www.seagate.com/">Seagate's web site</a>, but it was far easier to just "wing" it.  Finding a home inside my computer was kinda neat.  I found a nice place under my floppy.  It actually took a while to figure out how it would house my drive.  There is this little cradle that unscrews from under my floppy drive.  It attatches onto the new hard drive by sticking two little prongs into holes on one side of the drive while on the other side of the drive, you fasten it with a screw.  I was short on computer screws so this one screw mounting was pretty handy.  Then the cradle slides back into the spot under the floppy drive and you screw it tight and wallah, you are back in business.  Unfortunately they didn't give me jumper-dealies so I had to steal one from a network card I had lying around in order to set the SCSI ID to 1.  Then I played around and attempted to not cut the pricy SCSI cable.  I succeeded and I plugged in the drive.  I booted, the drive registered to the controller BIOS, and then NT started.  Opened up the disk administrator and played around with it and after ten minutes or so, I had a nice new NTFS partition on the new drive.  Well I copied my 2GBs of MP3s to the drive and it took under 25 minutes.  I think that is satisfactory.<p>
  Today some people are going to see Shakespeare with me.  I think that shall be pretty fun.  It's at Lake Harriet Bandshell.  I love that place.
