title: Middle East
excerpt: |-
  If you know nothing about the Middle East read <a href="http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/mideast/">this CNN/Time Guide</a> to whatever extent you can.
  <p>
  For me it filled all the holes of my understanding of the Middle East situation.  So far I have concluded that both the PLO and Israel are willing to conceded to the same things as a group, but a few individuals or groups of individuals ruin the peace process for everybody.  This should work out eventually over time theoretically.
