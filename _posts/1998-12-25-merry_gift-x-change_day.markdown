  I think what is most intimidating about Linux is that there is so much you can learn about using it.  I mean, after a few days, it's easy to master Windows 95/98 or even most of NT.  But with Linux, you keep learning all these things you can do.  This happens when you have an OS that keeps being updated constantly.

  A friend of mine emailed me with a well thought out email that seems to reflect a lot of <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ywong/">what Yishan said</a>.  So we decided that we are going to start advocating a techno-democracy where Congress will be held in a dance club and ... no wait... a techno-democracy where people use technology to be a part of the government.  We would have Representatives create bills and then for several of the bills we would hold a national referrendum.  This is all possible thanks to lengthy encryption/verification systems.  And it's true to the nature of democracy.  You know - majority rules.
  <p>Looks like my favorite OEM, Micron is hiring the Borg-chick from Star Trek.  
  <p>I have a new respect for my UIUC peers thanks to this article in Popular Science (December 1998).  A consortium consisting of 20 Chicago suburb school districts (a good portion of UIUC are alumnus of these schools) decided to be included as it's own country in TIMSS tests that are given to countries to figure out where they rank against the rest of the world.  The Consortium was fifth in the world for Mathematics and second for Science.  I feel very good about this fact.  The consortium uses different standards that sound remarkably like the standards Minnesota school use.  At least for mathematics.  They seem to be a lot better in teaching science.  Check this magazine article out it's on page 92, very neat so far.
  <p>On a sad note, I have no sound on my computer.
