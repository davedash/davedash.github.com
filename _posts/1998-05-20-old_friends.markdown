  It's silly that I didn't think of this before...<p>
  A person with whom I was friends a very long time ago (before preschool to first grade) has been "found."<p>
  I tried recalling her last name one day and I found it and where she lived - Eden Prairie.  This is where she moved after first grade.  It occurred to me today, that <a href="mailto:adame@ftmax.com">Adam</a> may know of her... and sure enough he did.  Now I have to creatively find this person and not scare her.  I'm not good at the second bit.  Oh well just the fact that I know where this person exists makes me happy.  Now I have to find a non-threatening way of meeting her...<p>It's so sad that I am just finding out about all my friends from long ago.
