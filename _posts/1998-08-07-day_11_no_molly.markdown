title: Day 11 No Molly
excerpt: |-
  Since many of you are going to college soon, you may need to arm yourself with this pieces of scripture:<blockquote><i>
  And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men.  I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.  But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen.  Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.<p>-Mathew 6:5-6
  </i></blockquote>
  This was on the KQ morning show.  Some listener was complaining about football players who pray when they make a good play.  I think it works well with the god people on campus.<p>
  Today I got a card stating that I've been accepted into the University of Illinois' First Year Impact program.  Yay?<p>
  Actually, now I have a new NIC card and 128MB more memory... hmm that brings me to 192MB of Memory.  64MB was manageable, 128 is comfortable and 192 is luxury for me, but memory was cheap enough for me to go for this.
  <p>
  I broke one of our casarole dishes today.  I don't know exactly how it fell, but it did.  We have so many, I doubt my mom will notice.<p>
  I got a call from my roommate today.  He seems really cool.  He's bringing a TV/VCR and a play station.  I don't require any of these things, but it's nice to know it's there.  I guess we're getting a microwave/fridge.  This is good... oh yeah, I can drink hot cocoa in the winter now... I can even steal food from the cafeteria!
  <p>It's my sister-in-law's birthday today.  We took Kelly to Buca to eat.  The food was very good.  I don't think I'll eat for a while.
