title: Take this Adam Engelhart
excerpt: |-
  <a href="http://takeyourdomainnameandshoveitupyourass@www.engelbot.com">
  Adam Engelhart</a>, reputed for having his own domain name states on <a href="http://takeyourloftandshoveitupyourass@www.engelbot.com">his web</a> site that he has a loft.  He goes on and on about how great his loft is... well guess what <a href="mailto:kaycandy@engelbot.com">Adam</a>?  I have cool stuff too!  Basically every student is at the <a href="http://www.urh.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois Residence Halls</a> is given a 2'x3.5' desk and a 1.5'x2' dresser that are of equal height.  So today I went to Menards (goddammit, if I hyper link it, you probably wouldn't go there... I mean it's Menards... what are they going to have on the damn site?) and bought a nice laminated piece of wood that just barely fits in my room that now sits between my desk and my dresser.  So I have a big L-shaped desk.  I also have my fridge and microwave right under it.  So there.
