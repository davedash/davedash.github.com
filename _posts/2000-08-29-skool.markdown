  I don't know where I left off... anyhow, I am living with six of my comrades... come over if you like, we love guests.  Email me if you need directions.
  
  <p>Move in has been fine, I take longer than most people to get all my stuff unpacked.  So I'm not fully settled.  We don't get Ethernet until October, so nuts to that.
  </p>
  <p>Today was a record high for CMI... good lord was it hot.  I also managed to dehydrate myself (I drank a lot of water though) by walking outside under the cursed yellow sun and working out twice.  I also re-twisted my foot since I decided to skate without an ACE wrap around my foot.  I'm going to leave this computer lab now, and put some ice on my foot.</p>
  <p>Happy Birthday Adam "Mr. Roboto" Nagao.</p>
