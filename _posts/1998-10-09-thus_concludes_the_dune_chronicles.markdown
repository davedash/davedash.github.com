title: Thus concludes the Dune Chronicles
excerpt: |-
  The <i>Dune Chronicles</i> have been read.  It's probably been one of the most interesting series I have ever read.  It wasn't just science fiction, and that's what made it a great book.  I think now I will take a break from reading books for a while.  The problem with reading a good series is that you start looking for more and more information on that universe.<p>
  There are things I did not like about Dune.  Despite the Butlerian Jihad, much of the technology did not match what we have had for years.  Most of this is due to the fact that it was written in the past.  Another problem was the progress of technology was a bit strange.  The Ancestral Memory and the preborn were another problem I had.  Those concepts did not seem like something that could work.  There were other little things that I disliked that would reveal too much of the book as well.<p>Despite all of these things I was captivated enough by the series, especially the final book, <i>Chapterhouse: Dune</i>.  I have to say that the final book is my absolute favorite.  I don't really have an order of preferance.<p>
  I guess the next series I'll tackle is <i>Ender's Game</i>...
