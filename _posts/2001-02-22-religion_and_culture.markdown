title: Religion and culture
excerpt: I think I am too interested in religion and culture.  I'd like to think that I have a good fundamental understanding of most of the world's religions.  Every now and then, I'll start researching into each culture.  Try to find out their beliefs on a certain subject.  Their views of certain people.  I should get a degree in religious studies.  I think that may be my goal.  Is after my BS in CS, I'll get Masters degrees in every other subject I like.
