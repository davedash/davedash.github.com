title: Fun with Ameritech
excerpt: |-
  So I was calling Ameritech to disconnect one of our extraneous phone lines at DIG-INTO.  I came across the following annoyances:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>To verify that I could make changes on this account, they just asked "are you authorized to make changes on this account?"  No security whatsoever.  It's one thing if they recognized me (almost impossible, judging the size of Ameritech), but no they just simply asked me and I said yes.  It probably helped that I was calling from the main phone line.</li>
  <li>I was persuaded to keep my line, since I might use it for a computer later on down the road.  The Customer Service Representative (CSR) went on to tout the benefits cited in her CSR handbook of having a secondary phone line.  I flatly told her that I am not worried about a measily $31 reconnection fee if I decide to reinstate my old phone line and that most people in this house have a mobile phone.</li>
  <li>The CSR sees that I have Caller ID... how perceptive.  This person isn't the least bit interested in saving me money, so I'd appreciated it if the CSR would not snoop around my account and try to get me into Ameritech's new money saving program.  She told me I'd be paying a little more per month, but the first month is free.  So I asked, do I have to call to cancel this service?  She said I would.  So I said I wouldn't want this service... I wouldn't remember to call to cancel it.</li>
  <li>Sales pitch over?  Heavens no!  Am I interested in buying a cordless phone?  Excuse me I think not.  Since when does phone provider get in the business of selling phones?  If I wanted a phone I would get one from the local electronics store.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'm surprised the CSR didn't bother selling me Girl Scout cookies.  At least that I'd consider paying for.  I for one, love my cell phone.  $30 a month for 120 minutes, which is extortion on AT&Ts part, but it is a much better value than anything Ameritech could ever give me.</p><p>
  That is one thing to AT&Ts credit.  I hope I don't jinx them by saying this, but at least they don't try to push things on me that I do not want.  The CSRs they have have been much nicer to me, and occasionally 1-800-IMAGINE will have a few down to earth people.
