title: Winning...
excerpt: |-
  Well summer if finally winding down... I can't really tell.  I probably won't be able to tell until I start planning to go back to school.
  <p>Work has been okay, even though it's suboptimal.  Actually I'm quite bored at work.  Three more games of soccer, and I don't see too much improvement in my game coming soon, so I will continue to suck.  Friday one of the "interns" leaves my department and I give my final presentation, which should be better than dull if I prepare for it.  The following Thursday is my last day of work and my exit interview.
  </p><p>
  Sunday I heard some good news from one of my favorite Jews, Marc.  He and Hayley will be coming to visit Chicago and take me to the safe haven that I call Minnesota.
  </p><p>
  I splurged a bit on Friday and got some Rollerblading toys including a skate bag, helmet and new axles.  These should prove useful at school.
  </p><p>In the meantime I wait for Julie to call me, so I can store my stuff at her house while I'm in Minnesota.  She'll most likely call just in the nick of time.
  </p><p>
  Later...</p>
