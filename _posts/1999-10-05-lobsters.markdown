title: lobsters
excerpt: Lobsters have over-ridden Allen Hall this year.  The thing with the lobsters are this.  When you eat the green goo stuff in them that goo takes over your body and you become a slave to the lobster.  If you ate any of those lobsters, question your acts.  Did decide to do something?  Or did the lobster make you decide.
