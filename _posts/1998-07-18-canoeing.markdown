  The group of kids we have for SEI II are great.  They are all smart and in class they are well behaved.  The girls get obnoxious during break time.  Actually not all the girls.  One girl is really cool and lots of people mistake her as a TA (unless they mistake Molly and I as students).  She's into nanotechnology, genetics, quantum physics.  Very cool kid.  We'll certainly miss these kids.  Marc's kids aren't that great.

  Thursday we went to an orchestra concert at Orchestra Hall.  We took my cousin with us too, it was pretty neat.  The concert had two good pieces at the beginning.  The rest I didn't like because it was all opera-like.  Adam, Molly, my cousin and I later went shopping at Rainbow.  Molly went home and Adam, my cousin and I had icecream sandwhiches (Kempswich).
  <p>
  I talked to my cousin for a while.  I won't see her for at least three years since she'll be in Germany with her family.  It's wierd.  I think she's looking forward to it.
  <p>
  Friday (yesterday) at the Northrup Turnaround where we pick up our kids there were huge trucks and busses.  It was of course Tori Amos and her stuff.  We didn't see her, but we did see her stuff.  Marc and I asked around the trucks whose stuff was whose and well we were pretty much right.  I offered my kids $20 if they could bring Tori Amos to class.  They failed, but I don't blame them.
  <p>
  Later that day Molly and I ate with Raj, Kelly and Adam.  Then Molly and I went to DanAmy and we went to see <i>the Wedding Singer</i>.  The second time around made me "get" everything.  Everything made sense now that I remembered it was the eighties that the story takes place.  Once again.  I recommend this "Romantic Comedy."  It is funnier than hell.
  <p>
  Today I woke up at 5, left home at about 6 and went canoeing after Paul Heinecke (and another boat went after Laureen Ojalvo) while they swam 5 miles in Lake Minnetonka.  Paul didn't make it all the way.  Laureen of course did, she got second place for her age group.  I think she rules!  Paul almost made it, but for a person who had very little sleep, did a lot of work the day before, and has not swum in supposedly 17 months... wow... that was awesome.  I realize that I may enjoy canoeing when there is less weight and people on the boat.  Less chance of things going bad I guess.  It was nice after I finished canoeing.  This was my second time going.  I went before with school that was cool too.  I think I should go again except with fewer people in the boat (four gets crowded).
  <p>
  Went to Tanya Zhu's house for her Graduation Party.  Most of the people were tired from canoeing or swimming or Smashing Pumpkins the night before or a mix.  Now I'm tired.
