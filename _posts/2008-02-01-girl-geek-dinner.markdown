Katie and I went to [Girl Geek Dinner](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/408117/).  The best thing about being a Geek Husband is having a Geek Wife to bring you as a guest.

The panel talk was pretty good.  Featuring:

* Irene Au, Director of User Experience, Google
* Rashmi Sinha, CEO, SlideShare
* Leah Culver, Lead Developer & Co-Founder, Pownce
* Sumaya Kazi, Entrepreneur & Social Media Manager, Sun Microsystems
* Katherine Barr (moderator), Partner, Mohr Davidow Ventures

What really made the talk was it had a lot of good advice in general.  Writing in a blog for example is how a lot of people got their credibility.  It's how I got mine, and why I now live in the bay area and ultimately why I work on del.icio.us.

The talk was really reaffirming of my move out here.  It also makes me want to code-like-mad.

Following the Django theme... Pownce was written in Django ;)
