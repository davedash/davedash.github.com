title: Freaked out implants
excerpt: |-
  My surgery didn't go quite to plan, as some of you may have found out.  I have some scabbing occuring on my right side of my left eyebrow.  This is where one of the sutures was for my stitch.  I am planning on having this problem dealt with during Thanksgiving break.  It is a tad tedious keeping the area clean (as in free from dead cells, etc).  Today their was this strange thing underneath the scab that I picked at.  Approximately 1-2cm of a silicon rod came out.  I immediately cut it with my swiss army knife's scissors.
  <P>Anyhoo, I called my doctor's office to update them, and I was just informed that my doctor can only see me on Tuesday.  So I'm going to skip class on Monday and Tuesday and go to Minnesota on the 20th and stay until the 28th.
  <P>Note to self: It's Thursday, not Friday today.
