title: Day 9 No Molly
excerpt: |-
  Wanna know something neat?  Well upsetting too, I guess.
  <blockquote><i>On Thursday night, July 30th, the facility that hosts Merriam-Webster's Web site was burglarized and its servers were stolen. We've managed to restore limited capacity, but we need to obtain new hardware from our suppliers before we can return to full service. We hope to have the entire site active again in a few days. We apologize for the inconvenience and hope you will bear with us as we deal with the situation.
  <p>
  Thank you for your patience.

  </blockquote>
  I wrote a note to my roommate and a letter to my inamorta.  Sorry, I'd give a link to that word, but they are using some Dictionary scripts that were made on the fly, and I don't want to use a non Merriam-Webster dictionary.
  <p>
  Mail is coming late again today.<p>
  I went to see <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>.  If you like to watch serious movies, I recommend it.  It's a bit gory, but every movie that you have seen that involves gore has been preparing you for this movie.  The violence and cruelty in this movie strengthens may hatred of war.  It's not just the destruction of resources, but the humanity.  This was a good movie, but not something that I could see another time.
