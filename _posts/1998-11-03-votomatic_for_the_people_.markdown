  A better analysis of my web logs show that page requests has doubled from July to August.  August is when the new site went up and people started getting on faster connections.  It's increased by over 1000 page requests each month since.  Each week of last month has had its page requests increased by about 100 hits too.  The top Universities are the U of M, UW, UI, NYU, CalTech, CMU, UPenn.  The top hosts are: Laureen, Adam, Yishan, Me, Dan (Hi Dan!), Daniel Lavenda, Mr. Borchert (Hi Dave!), Amy (Hi Amy), MikeJ,  some other Borchert computer, possibly Pat's (Hi Pat!).  Ten is enough people to list, I think.  I said hi to the people whom I didn't think visited my site.  The top page to visit is of course the random sentence generator which reloads itself over and over.  I bet that skews the traffic.  Those who look at the Random Sentence Generator for longer periods of time... well.. oh well.  The Journal is 15% of the traffic on this site, and is what people go to most (besides the main page, etc).  This was all generated by <a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/">Analog</a>.
  Laureen, Adam, you remember a few days ago, and you looked at Yishan's <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ywong/news/">news page</a>, and he called you things like a "geek" or "nerd?"  He was right. 
  <p>I like how the results graph doesn't show the entries that weren't voted for.  I'll impliment this change sometime.  I'm very busy this week.  I've got a test tomorrow night and the night after and an essay due Friday.  The Thursday test is horrid Graph Theory.
  <p>Holly crap, <a href="http://members.aol.com/triham/">Caroline</a> is a cool person, more of this model of human should be created for future generations... hmm I'm becoming Bene Gesserit like in my thinking.  Yes, we should keep an eye on this line.  This update is for you, because you asked for it.  I'd have probably updated anyway because of the elections.  I just think her web page is really neat, and she was in Newsweek.
  <p>
  We've been having November Rain in Urbana.  Very annoying and very cold.  However, my Jacket, which bundles me up more than Kenny's has nifty anti-weather mechanisms build into it.
  <p>I'm now reading <i>i, robot</i> from some guy named Asimov.  There's a small story that takes place in 1998.  The development in robotics/computers in the book is far different than what it will be in this universe.

  I voted using an IBM Votomatic!  I voted mostly all democratic, just because I wasn't up to speed on all the issues of all the candidates in all the races I had to vote for.  Ryan (R) beat Poshard (D) for Gubenautical race.  Moseley-Braun (D) is behind by 100K votes v. Fitzgerald (R) for the Senatorical race.  I also think incumbent, E-wing (R) creamed Prussing 63 to 37 percent.  Then there is Minnesota... all I can say is good luck Jesse, who just won.
