title: India Night
excerpt: |
  Caroline and I went to a terrific event put on by the Indian Students Association, India Night.  
  If any of you have been to any Indian events with me (Molly, Adam, KT, etc) 
  you probably can agree with me that the sound is terrible.  The sound 
  was done fairly well here.  As was the programming guide and most importantly 
  the dances.  I saw a few of my friends perform and they all did very well.
  <p>In other news, with my ethernet restored and my sound enabled, I am 
  no longer a grumpy little CS major.  I have a few scores to settle.  
  Samba (networking to Windows computers) is yet to be mastered, 
  ripping CDs from my SCSI drive is not  yet working (may work after a 
  reset, but I don't want to do that).  My microphone recordings sound 
  like "ass."  Videoconferencing is not yet implemented, etc.  My 
  primary focus is figuring out something so I can get the video camera 
  working and making the microphone less "ass" sounding like.  Then I 
  can talk to the girl.
  <p>Academically I'm feeling a bit out of the loop.  Math is getting 
  slightly devilish.  CS 173 is following suit.  CS 110 Java is out 
  there as well.  Physics is troubling me with Torque.  I think I can 
  handle them all though.
  <p>Well I've got to go pour some lambs blood on my door now, so goodnight.
