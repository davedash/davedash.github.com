title: WebValley (formerly Profile National Business Directory)
excerpt: |-
  My dad called me about <a href="http://www.startribune.com/cgi-bin/stOnLine/article?thisSlug=WEB22">this article</a> in the Business section of the Star Tribune.
  <p>During the summer of 1997 I worked at <a href='http://www.busdir.com/'>Profile National Business Directory</a>.  I was designing a prototype internet mall, but I did hear about the phone-scams.  I felt what the company was doing was morally wrong.  They were praying on people who were not only ignorant of the internet, but people who didn't even authorize any work to be done.
  <P>I talked to a few people at the company and realized that the company slowly outsourced everything (including design to a company in India).  The design of the sites was done using coldfusion scripts and made it very easy for people to create.  No effort was required.  The process was made to be as cheap as possible.
  <P>I always felt that I should have made a complaint somewhere, but what ended up happening is probably good enough for me.
  
  <P>So the moral of the story?  Well first, don't cheat people.  Secondly, pay close attention to your bills.
