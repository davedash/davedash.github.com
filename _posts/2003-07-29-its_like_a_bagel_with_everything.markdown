title: It's like a Bagel with Everything!
excerpt: So keeping in tradition of not posting for quite some time, here is yet another post.  The good news is most of this is good news.  I've gone through unemployment, attended a wedding, gone fishing for my first time ever, went on a boat ride and got the exact job I wanted.  Most of this happened in the cozy months of June and July.  Read on.

So keeping in tradition of not posting for quite some time, here is yet another post.  The good news is most of this is good news.  I've gone through unemployment, attended a wedding, gone fishing for my first time ever, went on a boat ride and got the exact job I wanted.  Most of this happened in the cozy months of June and July.  Read on.<!--more-->So my 3 month contract came to an end as promised at the end of May.  I missed not having a job, but I wasn't too stressed out.  I had enough money to keep myself afloat.  I spent most of the months trying to get a job and as you'll soon find out, it paid off.

I also attended Tim and Molly's wedding.  Yet another of my friends has made the plunge into married life.  It was a great little ceremony (30 minutes long, no kidding!).  That week was filled with hanging out with friends.  Something I truly enjoy.  We also went canoeing, and that's something I hope to repeat this summer.  Possibly in St. Croix.

Katie's parents brought us out fishing on White Bear Lake.  It was my first time fishing and I caught the first fish.  It was great.  We followed up that Friday (4th of July) with bringing more family on Katie's parents' baby yacht.  That was also a blast (pardon the pun).

To top it all off, I wound up with a job and started last week.  I do PHP development for the Eden Prairie School district.  Right now I'm maintaining my friend, Scott Hughes, old application.  By maintain, I mean scrapping and rewriting.

It's a wondeful feeling to be doing PHP and getting paid.  I love PHP with a passion and writing code in it, although sometimes a chore, overall is quite exciting because the results are fast seen.  It's also a pleasure to actually not mind staying a little later just to get something to work right, or to not dread going into work the next day.  Hopefully that will last for quite some time.
