title: War
excerpt: |
  War.  I have an aversion to war and this war.  It would be nice if we could do something besides a war, like a tactical mission.  Take over it's power centers without loosing too many people.  The war will do.  I do not believe this war has anything to do with the impeachment.  The war would have happened anyway.  I believe that we are going to war for the right reasons: so the weapons aren't in the hands of the bad people.  In our case the bad people is Iraq.  They are a threat to us.  It's foolish to think that no country will have nuclear weapons.  It isn't, however, foolish to think that the countries that do have them will not use them.  If going to war means lowering the chance of a nuclear conflict, then let us go to war.
  <p>I wish people would shut up about Ramadan.  It doesn't matter that the war may go into Ramadan.  Ramadan is a month long fasting for Muslims.  It teaches them to give up things or restraint.  Basically you go the day without water and food, and at night you can eat and drink (although not in excess to make up for the lack of food, this would defeat the purpose).  If Iraqi soldiers are mostly Muslim we may think that we are fighting a bunch of thirsty, hungry people.  I have been told, however, that Islam is an understanding religion.  It is absurd to risk your life in order to follow a rule so strictly, so exceptions can be made.  I, however, do not really think the religious details mean that much.  We are going to war.  We will fight whenever we feel like.  The fact that it is Ramadan, may make it easier for us.   That's too bad.  What if we went to war against a primarily Jewish state like New York... err Israel.  Would we have ethical questions about fighting on Shabaat?  I mean, the Jews can't use technology during Shabaat.
  <p>So, now that we are plunged into war, we should make it fast.  We need not lose lives or inanimate resources over Iraq and its transgressions.  After the war, we will install whatever government we please.  The best idea would be to create a satellite government in Iraq.  That, however, is unlikely.  We should be conquerers, not destroyers.
