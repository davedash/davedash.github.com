I haven't been completely happy with myself lately.  

I am happy with my life in general, and external things.  In fact, let me preface this post by saying that I'm happy with my wife, my friends and my family.  Even my job is pretty good despite the oncoming layoffs which I hopefully won't be subjected to, but you never know.

I mainly see my intellectual and physical development hasn't been where I'd like, despite an urge to advance in both areas (i.e. in more simplified terms I'm getting dumber and fatter).

This post isn't meant to be a downer... my hope is I can improve on each of these aspects one by one.  I think it's completely natural to have peaks and troughs in terms of personal development.  I think it's when I identify a low that I make valiant efforts at trying to improve myself.  Let's see how things go.

I'll attempt to post more details.  One of the things I want to do is keep a better journal of my life, be it a blog or otherwise... it seems to be what all the cool kids are doing ... or were doing ;)
