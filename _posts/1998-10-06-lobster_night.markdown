title: Lobster Night
excerpt: "Oh my.. Lobster night at UIUC.  Most of the residence halls server Lobster.  It was mildly incredible.  I didn't eat any because lobster looks disgusting and I don't like sea food too much.  Some people went a little overboard.  One person was about to eat ten lobsters.  For some reason all seafood disgusts me.  No wonder why the Jews don't eat most sea food.  They secretly want me on their team.  "
