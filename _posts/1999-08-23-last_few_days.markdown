title: Last few days
excerpt: |-
  In the last few days I pretended to dance, my roommate, Brendon, moved in and I started working on people's computers.  It's been quite busy.  Sometimes busier than I'd like.
  <P>
  Yesterday was the Illini Union Late-Nighter.  I was thinking of not going, because I was tired after work.  Then I kicked this freshman named Kathy out of the computer lab, because I thought she should be at the Late-Nighter.  Since she was alone, I offered to go with her.  The event was a blast.  <A HREF='http://www.spicyclamato.org'>Spicy Clamato</A> was there and so was a Hypnotist and so was a lot of other stuff.
  <P>Today looks like the day I try to get things in order... right...  I figure, since the Freshman are at convocation, I won't have to do anything until later tonight.
