title: Freshlings...
excerpt: Today was the final day of training.  The night went well.  Several of my friends and I joined the Freshman in the orientation stuff.  We had fun doing that.  Then afterwards we ended up having a party in the hall outside my room.  There'll be some pretty wild pictures of me as soon as Caroline or I develop our respective rolls of film.  Unfortunately I am exhausted after pseudo-dancing for quite some time and then going shopping at Meijer's.  (Note that the time is based on EST, even though I'm in CST.)
