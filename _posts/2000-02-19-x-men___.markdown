title: X-men...
excerpt: |-
  So the other day, I was at Savoy watching Cider House Rules with the Julies (this was two weeks back, I think).  There I saw a thing for X-men, the movie.  I thought, cool.  I also thought, "Professor Xavier is bald, so is Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard).  I bet he's going to be the professor."  Was I right, or was I right?
  <p>Here's some dialogue for you to enjoy:</p>
  <blockquote><tt>
  Julie(S): Do you want me to pee on you?<br />
  Julie(D): Yes, I do.  I want to drink it too.
  </tt></blockquote>
