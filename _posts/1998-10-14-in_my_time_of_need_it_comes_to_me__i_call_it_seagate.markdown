title: In my time of need it comes to me, I call it Seagate!
excerpt: Seagate is horking me a new drive today!  It's bein sent by Airborne Express's 2nd Day Air.  Which is very nice.  I'm happy.  You see my current drive is being crowded.  I also want ample space to rip CDs.  Allen Hall's library has been touting their ample collection of CDs and they have stuff that's interested be, such as Moby.  They also have Chemical Brothers and Nursat Fateh Ali Kahn.  Well maybe not all in Allen Hall, but somewhere in the hall libraries.<p>I guess somehow we are going to get a lot of Transformer episodes among the minions of Allen Hall.<p>I saw Jack going smokey-smokey.  I read a web page that talked about things you should not do in an online Journal, one was to refer to people by name unless you knew it was okay.  I don't think this counts.  I'm a bad bad man.
