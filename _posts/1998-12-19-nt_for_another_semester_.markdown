  My computer's been producing a lot of heat recently, and I thought placement may have 
  
  been a problem, so I moved it to the ground where their is more ambient air flow.  
  
  Tuesday I realized the massive fan was damaged.  So I removed it and yesterday I 
  
  purchased a smaller weaker fan, that will hopefully suffice.  The computer isn't as 
  
  hot, so I think it will suffice.
  <p>Also, Tuesday I decided to format my C:\ drive where all my programs reside.  It 
  
  took me hours to figure out that I needed to remove my Jaz SCSI card and then install 
  
  NT, otherwise there'd be conflicts.  It took me a very long time to figure this out.  
  
  I installed NT alone, on a new video card, under Windows 98, everything.  I was about 
  
  to give up and become like Hackel, but I finally figured it out.  Actually I was 
  
  thinking about BeOS, because that has NTFS compatibility and looks pretty and is fast.
  <p>
  It took me an entire day to install everything so it was back to normal.  I am going 
  
  to format again in six months, unless Windows 2000 Pro is being released around that 
  
  time, then I will wait and upgrade.  I need to get better at restoring my system.  
  
  Although, it only took a day, which is amazing.
  <p>Now I am running Litestep, which after sufficient tweaking runs pretty nicely.  
  
  Unfortunately they don't have an easy way to add programs to the warf bar.  I decided 
  
  that that doesn't matter so much, because I only use a handful of things, and it's fun 
  
  to make my own icons.  The Virtual Window Manager will take a while to get used to as 
  
  well.  I've resolved most issues that made me retreat to explorer, so I think 
  
  Litestep'll stay.
  <p>It feels like a perpetual weekend with no homework, it's nice:)
  
  <p>Here is some information on Northwestern's <a 
  
  href="http://www.nbnn.com/pubNews/123239.html">Photon Chip</a>.  It's basically that 
  
  uses photons rather than electrons for computing.  Quantum Tunnelling is used instead 
  
  of gates.  I forget what gates are, and I have no idea what Quantum Tunnelling is.
  
  <p>I'm somewhat scared of the consequences of our attack on Iraq in respect to opposition countries.  Russia is not going to ratify START II and they have a poor view of our master Klynton err Clinton.
  
  <p><a href="http://www.pricescan.com">Pricescan.com</a> is a nice interface.  Use it when you buy stuff.
  
  <p>Finished my final final tonight, it felt good.  I made some pasta too, it was also good.  I'm ready to return home and relax for a month.  Basic flight information is as follows:  I leave CMI at 1:45PM.  I arrive in DTW 4:10PM.  I immediately leave DTW at 4:40PM and arrive at MSP 5:44PM via flight NW3306.  Upon arriving I'll probably sleep.:)
  
  <p>I don't know how often I'll be able to update this page over break.  My computer at home will be getting a new CD-ROM and a new Operating System (Debian Linux).  Until then, the computer will remain very slow, since WinNT server is very bogged down )it's a bit hard to reinstall without that CD-ROM).  Due to this slowness I'll refrain from using my computer whenever possible (I may leave it online a lot though).  I'll spare you the details.
  <P>Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  My old ryche site got picked as a <a href=" http://directory.mozilla.org/Arts/Music/Artists/Queensryche/Empire_Pages/">cool site</a>...
