title: Network Cards
---
I purchased a number of inexpensive 3COM network cards.  So if anybody just happens to need a card, let me know.  I think I'm paying less than $5 a piece for them.  I always run into this problem of not having enough cards, and now that I can buy 10 cards for half the price it used to cost for one, I bought a good ammount.I'll be using these for my wireless network setups.
