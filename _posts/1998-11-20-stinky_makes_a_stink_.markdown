  Wednesday we were little kids again at Fat Don's (a campus specialty restaurant).  We played with the Ketchup and the Steak Sauce Bottle.
  
  <p>I hit the jackpot for MP3s.  I've found all these neat live Aphex Twin and Orbital songs.  The only difference from a studio and live cut is an audience and it sounds different slightly.  Sometimes the sound is a little low quality, due to who recorded it, etc.  The Orbital songs from Birmingham tend to have too much bass... that forces me to have to deal with Winamp's equalizer.  The song of the week is an Orb song.  Supposedly it's <i>Toxygene</i> live in Moscow, but it sounds nothing like the two other versions of <i>Toxygene</i> that I have.  It's very space-future sounding.  I've listened to it so much that I can't place it with another song that I've heard, becuase it's too familiar.  The other two Toxygenic songs are mass-media-future sounding.  Like something we'd have sometime soon.  Supposedly the new Winamp (2.04+) are supposed to get rid of skips and stuff, but that's not happening.  Oh well.  I'll try to get my latest collection to the MP3 server in the sky before I leave.  I'll at least start uploading by Sunday.  I'd hate to go home and find myself musicless... although my CD-player supposedly works... and I could go CD shopping with my Jewish friend.
  
  <p>I'm really being pushed I guess.  My Thanksgiving break will be relaxing, but I fear I'll be spending a lot of time composing a rough draft for my speech on an inclusive education model.  Dammit, I need a day.  Not just a day where I have no obligations, but a day where I have no future obligations to worry about.  I have an outline due Friday, stuff to read, a paper due next week, a speech in a few weeks, end of the quarter soon, immunization tests that need be done, credits that need to be transferred propperly, class registration that needs to be propperly done.
  
  
  <p>Stinky made a stink tonight.  I have witnesses, Neal, Mike, and anyone else who was unfortunate to walk by my room.  I had to leave my room and go talk to the Katie with the red hair.  Eventually the stink faded away.  I don't want to sound like I'm exaggerating, but it was really bad.  Mothballs and open windows should cure the room.
  
  <p>
  I heard Stinky talking to Josh in the hallway and I asked Josh in ICQ what Stinky said about the PSX (PlayStation):
  <blockquote><tt>
  You'll be really happy...he said he's not bringing it back after Thanksgiving...cuz he's gonna have to study for finals...Don't celebrate TOO loudly...:):)</tt>
  </blockquote>
  If all goes well, this is a permanent thing.
