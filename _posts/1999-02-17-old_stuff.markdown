  Okay, I've just found these two paragraphs somewhere that should be posted I guess...
  <p>
  This Friday I went to Culture Shock, a multicultural event at the Illini Union.  It was 
  
  pretty good.  I was kinda tired and wasn't really their with anybody in particular.  I went 
  
  their with Neal and Fal' who later left for a semi-formal and then I came back to Allen Hall.
  <p>
  Saturday I went shopping at Meijer.  I got a free knife and I beat Mike to finding a caller 
  
  ID box.  Caller ID Box?  That's right... We had to go find a caller ID box and the person 
  
  who brought it back to the 107.1 radio station guy got a to choose a CD.  So I got a CD from 
  
  VAST.  Which I would have ordered from Columbia House otherwise.  I like the CD.  It has the 
  
  song <i>Touched</i> on it.
  <p>This is very wierd... I guess those things fit in somewhere with the Dave Dash timeline.  I have like several sheets of notes that I have from my legal pad that should go in the journal too.  It's interesting I guess.
