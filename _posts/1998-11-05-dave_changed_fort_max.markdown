  I've started reading CNN, more often.  I'm sure you will notice the side effects.  And also relating to the page... I've placed the journal on the opening screen and I doubled the length of data that gets displayed.  I updated the <a href="http://www.ftmax.com/calendar.php3" target=_self>Calendar</a>, the <a href="http://www.ftmax.com/friends.html" target=_self>Friends page</a> and fixes the random problems with how links open.
  
  <p>I heard the KQRS apology regarding the comments made regarding the Hmong.  The result is that they have given in to Citizens Against Racism.  There will be no more <i>Talk with Tak</i>, featuring Tak the person from Grand Forks with an accent that's surprisingly Oriental sounding.  I guess not stating his race does not matter.  I think KQ should make up a new character with an accent that can't quite be traced. :)  I'm interested in what others think of <i>Talk with Tak</i> or what you think would define something as being racist.
  
  <p>Jesse the Body was on <a href="http://www.kqrs.com/">KQ</a>.  He also made the <a href="http://www.illinimedia.com/di/nov_98/nov5/news/news02.html">front page of the Daily Illini</a> (not the feature article, but the front page nonetheless).  Most of my news that I throw at you is usually computer stuff, so here's something <a 
  href="http://www.maximumpcmag.com/inside_sources/98.11/98.11.4.phtml#ABCNEWSCOMPredictsFuture">from Maximum PC</a> that mentions "the wrestler."

  <p>Apple has a new deal where you can Rent-to-Own an iMac for $30 a month.  Sure, it sounds like a good deal.  Only a little bit more than unlimited Internet access... except you realize that this is for 67 months.  After the first year or two you'll feel like your machine is really out-dated.  Then you realize that you are paying $30 for the next 43 months for an outdated computer that, from many peoples view points, wasn't very good computer brand new.
  
  
  
  <p>Matt Sundberg graduated from High School today.  Slacker.  
  <p>Anybody who uses the mega-gigantic dryers in Allen Hall should not leave their laundry in their for more than 10-15 minutes.  It's really annoying, because if you don't use those and have a decent ammount of laundry, you have to run your load a few times.  
  <p>The 52 lbs. package has been spotted in Cach, IL at 9:47 PM today.  It should be expected to arrive tomorrow or Monday.  The last time I saw something at Cach, IL I got it the next day or the day after.  That was of course in MN, but now that I live in IL, it should be here sooner.  That's right, I live in IL.  I am IL.
  <p>I wonder if I've regained control of my will power.  Jack's Taco Bell poster finally fell.  Jack missed two classes today because he went to sleep at six in the morning.
  
  <p>I took my second math test.  It hurt.
  <p>I love <a href="http://www.lyrics.ch/query/get?s=66980">this</a> song.  "Give it to me, baby!"
