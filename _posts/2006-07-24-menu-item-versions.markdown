<p>We make a lot of mistakes, and by we, I don&#8217;t mean myself, but I mean we as humanity.  That&#8217;s why we like to keep multiple versions of things in our <a href="http://reviewsby.us/">restaurant review</a> database.  That also means menu items.  Did you describe the <a href="http://reviewsby.us/restaurant/newsroom/menu/pesto-chicken-sandwich">Pesto Chicken</a> as having <em>pisto</em> and not <em>pesto</em>?  Problem solved, now any user can log in and change it.  It&#8217;s like a wiki&#8230;. for restaurant menus.</p>
