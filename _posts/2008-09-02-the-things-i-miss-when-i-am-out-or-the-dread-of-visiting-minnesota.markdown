title: The things I miss when I am out... (or the dread of visiting Minnesota)

Here's what I'm missing in the South Bay in the next week:

* [Django Con](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/921974/) is on the 6th of September
* Free Agile Training is on the 10-11th
* Yahoo [Hack Day](http://www.hackday.org/) is on the 12-13th.

I am looking forward to seeing my friends' wedding, and taking a look at my house, and settling some financial affairs, but all in all, I'm not looking forward to Minneapolis at all.

Visiting Minneapolis is way different than living in Minneapolis.  It involves being away from home, taking care of affairs that are easier done in Minneapolis than in CA (we have professional contacts that we'd like to keep that live in Minneapolis as well as a small piece of rental property).

It involves driving around a lot... which is why I've been on a kick to get a folding bike so I can take it with me next time.  I don't drive much at all in the Bay Area, and I never did that much in Minneapolis.

It also involves working out of a coffee shop or possibly the Tea Garden, while I enjoy doing that, I don't really enjoy doing that all the time.

It's also the idea that this is taking place of a proper vacation where I can just rest.

It's also going to be hot... and that's compared to being in the South Bay.  I'll make the best of it, and I'll enjoy what I can... but sitting at home, I am not really looking forward to this trip.
