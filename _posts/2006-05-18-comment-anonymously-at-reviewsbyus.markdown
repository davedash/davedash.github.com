I decided to overhaul the comment system on the [reviewsby.us][rbu] site.  I implemented an <acronym title="Asynchronous Java and XML">AJAX</acronym> form and allow anonymous comments.  Anonymous comments is a slippery slope, but reading [about friction][1] and [identity][2] some things need to be taken into account.

The site is new.  It's going to take a while before it generates a lot of traffic and therefore members and therefore comments.  But it would be nice to keep collecting information and make that collection as painless as possible.  Of course the potential for spam is high, but when/if that happens there are safeguards that can be put in place.  I imagine, until a decent membership base is established, the rules for who can and cannot post will probably change every now and again.
