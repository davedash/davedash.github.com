title: Illinois, the blow-me state...
excerpt: |
  Here's a chock full of superficiality...
  <p>I got this thing called <i>imwheel</i> working under Linux so that it 
  makes my Intellimouse work just like it did in Windows.  On the otherhand 
  this 'loaner' network card I am using is as hell.
  <p>Here's <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_328000/328442.stm>something funny</a>
   about the President of the free world.
  <p>Did you know that it's like no TV week or something?  I guess peopel watch
  around 3 hours or more per day... you people suck.  
  <p>Apple now owns the rights to the MP3 codec which originally were created 
  at the Fraunhauffer Institute (which is from Germany, like <a href=http://www.jawed.com/>Jawed</a>).
