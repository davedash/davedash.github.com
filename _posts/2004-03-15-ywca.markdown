Is anybody here a member of the YWCA?  Katie and I work out at my parents which is free, but it has no pool, and it's only convenient for me since it's on my way from work.

Medica gives us a discount at LifeTime fitness, but it's still $80/mo per human.  Northwest Athletic Club is $90/mo per couple, but doesn't have any great locations.  They manage Calhoun Beach Club, which would be ideal, but no discounts there.  They also hire molesters.

YWCA is $70/couple and on my way to work, and is near my house.  It's summer though, I could just Rollerblade(tm) all day.
