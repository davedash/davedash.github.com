title: Pennies for Dave
excerpt: Hey, if any of you ever see me, could you give me pennies?  I have this large jar that maybe has $5.00 worth of pennies, maybe more... probably like $7.00.  I don't exactly know because the last time I counted was over 5 years ago.  Anyway, I want to try to fill it in four years with pennies.  That's about 20 cents a day (based on really rough estimates).  So anyway, if you guys could just give me all your excess pennies that you'd rather not have to deal with, that would be great.  Also, I don't want people stealing money from penny fountains, penny collections and those things they have at gas stations where you give your excess pennies and you take out pennies that you may need so you can have exact change.
