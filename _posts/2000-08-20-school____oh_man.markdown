title: School... oh man!
excerpt: |-
  Dan and Marc are dropping me off at school.  Oh man... that means I have to go learn now... haven't moved into my house yet, and supposedly no internet until Tuesday... oh well...
  <p>It's good to be back at school.  I need a personal assistant who can type up these things for me.</p>
  <p>Oh, did I mention... between this post and the last posting... I went up to Minnesota for a week where I managed to sprain my ankle while rollerblading (I blame Tanya), see <i>Small Time Crooks</i>, cook in the death kitchen, play scrabble, play soccer (poorly with no functioning right foot) and hang out with Dan, Ryan, Katie, Tanya, Mike, Matt, Marc, Hayley and the gang?  Well if I didn't, last week I went up to Minnesota for a week where I managed to sprain my ankle while rollerblading (I blame Tanya), see <i>Small Time Crooks</i>, cook in the death kitchen, play scrabble, play soccer (poorly with no functioning right foot) and hang out with Dan, Ryan, Katie, Tanya, Mike, Matt, Marc, Hayley and the gang.
