title: " Life in the material aftermath"
excerpt: |-
  The following is my brother's post:
  
  <p>
  The end is not near. It is here. Really, with an economic upheaval that is really based on
  a lot of things that are somewhat artificial.
  </p><p>
  Yesterday's exorbitant wealth is slowing down for a lot of people. Internet frenzy,
  earning expectations are slowing and dropping because artificaily, too many things were
  too high.
  </p><p>
  Materially, the world has been taking it on the chin for some time now. The Europeans and
  the Pacific rim countries have nowhere near the opulance of our latest wealth.
  </p><p>
  This slow-down will invariably be frightening..but why? Oh no, buying cars that do not
  come with leather, or sport utes that used to be decadence ala labotamy.
  Think of this upcomming leanness as an opportunity for the rest of America to get along as
  most college kids do regularly..with a little suffering. A little cost-consciesness.
  </p><p>
  I for one will take a beating financially, I know I will make much less money next year
  than my last two years. Hey, I need the discipline.
  </p><p>
  Dave will be going to India for a few days at the beginning of next year and be reminded
  once again how good we have it in the US. God has chosen to make us quite fortunate
  really. Our concerns are nowhere near the gravity of others in far off worlds, or even
  next door in our own home-towns.
  </p><p>
  In America, we can actually suffer and have two cars two tvs and two vcrs! Is this a great
  country or what?
