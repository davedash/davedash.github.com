excerpt: |-
  And you would be sad.
  <p>Today my Uncle and his family gave me the X-files movie on VHS Cassette (I'm guessing this would be Julie and Auntie's idea).  I watched it.  It was similar to a long episode of the X-files that was pretty good.  It's just not nearly as cool the second time around.
  <p>Later tonight Molly came over and we eventually gave birth to cookies.  They were good despite the pain we went through (no, just forget I used the word "birth" in that last sentence).
  <p>My brother shall be returning soon.  Last I heard he and Kelly were in Thailand.
  <p>Thank you and before I say goodnight, I leave you with a pleasant <a href="http://www.azstarnet.com/~rhi/wedding.html">link</a>.  (Note: This will make sense to Run-Friends and perhaps nobody else, except maybe Su').
