excerpt: "I wrote the following in the plane and told most of it to Molly, \r\n\
  already so here's it's third incarnation.. the web-journal!\r\n\
  <P>\r\n\
  Yesterday was Raj Senapati's graduation party.  It was very nice.  \r\n\
  More people showed up to his, than my party last year.  This trip\r\n\
  was very nice overall. [Note: I was in a town called Bloomfield \r\n\
  Hills.  It's rightly called that since it actually had significant \r\n\
  elevation changes which are absent from those in central Illinois.]\r\n\
  <P>\r\n\
  I went to the 12:30 am showing of Austin Power's 2.  Raj didn't think\r\n\
  it was that great, but I thought it was awesome.  I liked Heather \r\n\
  Graham a lot too (albiet some say that she can't act) she was very \r\n\
  fun and bouncy and perky.  It also addressed my problems with time\r\n\
  travel very nicely.\r\n\
  <P>Anyway, I made it to my gate (G8 in fact... gate= g + 8) with \r\n\
  sufficient time.  I have double reservations for my flight back \r\n\
  to Champaign and it came in handy since I got a seat.\r\n\
  They are overbooked (as always) and are looking for volunteers to \r\n\
  go take a flight to Minneapolis and then take a flight to Bloomington,\r\n\
  Illinois and then ground travel to Champaing... gotta board.\r\n\
  <P>Anyway (on the plane now) so they'd also pay for food anad everything and give me $300.  I was once offered $600 USD (Winter Break journal entry) and it was simply to take a later flight.  This however seemed inconvenient.  \r\n\
  Although if I had known how much time and they offered me more money, it would have been 'neat' to see Molly.\r\n\
  <P>So yeah, up the ante to $600 and I'dve figured out something.  I might \r\n\
  be late for work, but oh well...\r\n\
  <P>So I'm on the plane, I have a back row seat actually I had 3 seats\r\n\
  to my disposal, but somebody took the one that faced the aisle for the legroom.\r\n\
  So I have 2 seats.  I've never been in the back seat, this should be fun.  \r\n\
  [Note: It wasn't too different from any where else on the plane.]\r\n\
  I heard the ride's a bit bumnpier.\r\n\
  <P>They didn't clean this plane very well... assholes.\r\n\
  <P>My boarding card is neat (not 'neat').<BR>It says I'm elite.<BR>In\r\n\
  fact \"Elite Gold\"... it's written in <B>BOLD</B>!\r\n\
  <P>I love flying, it's such an ego boost.  Like I feel like a secret agent.  And you get to hang out with semi-cool people on mini-planes... and yeah plane's moving... wtf?  oh yeah... hehe it has to take off.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  <P>My professor travels a lot and it seems like that would be a fun thing to do,\r\n\
  just visit all these cool places.  I want to fly and visit the world.  Visit \r\n\
  different places over and over again.  It's so spyish.  Like I piccture myself\r\n\
  in Europe outside a coffeeshop, wearing  ablack leather trench coat, sipping hot cocoa (I \r\n\
  don't like Coffee).  This is a mix of the last scene in Mission Impossible and Keanu Reaves in the Matrix.  I think... \r\n\
  [Note: Dave thinks wrong.  It's more of the Saint than anything.]\r\n\
  <P>Someone at Raj's party mentioned I looked a little young (for college)\r\n\
  and tough looking.  I think it's this darth maulesque look that I have.  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  Well a mix of Maul and my brother because (dammit plane stop being bumpy)\r\n\
  autnies who knew my bfamily said I looked like my brother.  \r\n\
  Anyway I like this look.  It's not quite Maul, but I can do Maul's tough\r\n\

  I could do that for converge-con maybe... that'd be wierd... hmm need to \r\n\
