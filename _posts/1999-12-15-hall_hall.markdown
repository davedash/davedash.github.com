title: Hall Hall
excerpt: If you are a regent, a president, a benefactor or a great professor (although I'm not sure if honor is bestowed upon great professors) and your name is Hall, does the university make a Hall Hall?  In the main library at the University of Illinois there is an exhibition display (that happens to be empty) which was given as a commemoration to a few members of the Biology and Chemistry department.  Among them was someone named Hall (Vincent Hall if I'm not mistaken, but I'm too lazy to go back out and check.  It'd be funny if it was Vincent Hall, because that is the hall at the University of Minnesota where I was trained in mathematics).  What if this person, Professor Hall gave the University a huge crap load of money?  Like enough to build a hall.  Do they call it Hall Hall?
