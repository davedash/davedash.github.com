title: Where do I begin?
excerpt: |
  I have 4GB of Depeche Mode thanks to Caroline (who deserves no link since she has yet to move her page to a decent location).  I love it.  I can listen to it over and over and over and every once in a while I here a non Mode song.
  <p>Apparently I won 100 free laser printings at <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/ccso/">CCSO</a> labs for filling out a survey.  Which is all cool.  Also, people who are under ews have 600 pages of printing free as well (which makes sense).
  <p>So yeah, I work for the department of Curriculum and Instruction for the <a href="http://chickscope.beckman.uiuc.edu/">Chickscope Project</a>.  I've attended two meetings.  The last one was a four hour class.  It was all cool.  I think I'll have fun at this job.  Unfortunately the web server I get to use is a Macintosh.  It's alright though, I can do anything.
  <p>The Chemical Brothers is an amazing group.  Listen to the song <i>Where do I begin</i>.  It's very soothing and makes you think, "Wow, this is Chemical Brothers?" 
  <p>I got a hair cut.  By description it's been approved by Molly.  It's at a length where I don't really need to do too much to comb my hair.  Although, after spring break or something, it's going to be a shorter cut so I never have to comb.
  <p>I was supposed to go the ISA semi-formal yesterday, but my date was sick.  I really didn't care one way or another if I went.  It was just something to do.  Instead I got physics done.  Molly was a 'witness' to this.
  <p>That's all the Dave you need for now...
