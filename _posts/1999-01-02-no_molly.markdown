excerpt: |-
  I saw <i>Wind in the Willows</i> done using the cast from Monty Python.  It was wonderful.  I had forgotten the story and this was a nice representation.  Toad got on my nerves a little bit.  The defense was great during the trial.
  <p>Afterwards we ate at the Lotus and I went CD shopping with Adam Engelhart.  I purchased three albums, Bad Religion's <i>No Control</i>, Orb's <i>Orbvs Terrarvm</i> (can someone explain the etymology?) and Meat Beat Manifesto's <i>Storm the Studio</i> which consists of four multi-part songs.  The albums seemed good at the store, perhaps they will live up to my expectations.
  <p>I've also noticed that the car kit tools I use no longer seem to work.  Namely the CD-tape device.  I will see if it's just my CD player or something.
