This is a great book to get a quick overview of leading political theories in the realm of anarchy (a situation with no formal government).  It demolishes the skewed popular perceptions of anarchy as being a free for all kill or be killed type of world.<!--more-->Miller himself is not an anarchist, but his insights into anarchy are worthwhile.  Contrasting Anarcho-Communism, Individualist Anarchism and the modern nation-states gives an informative insight into this often neglected and misinterpreted ideology.Miller isn't quick to dismiss or approve of anarchy, but offers what he sees as its strengths and weaknesses.  This book greatly broadened my understanding of anarchism and what an anarchist is and/or believes.
