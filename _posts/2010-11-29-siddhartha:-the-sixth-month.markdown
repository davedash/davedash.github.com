Siddhartha: The sixth month

Six months ago, we were playing the waiting game.  Katie woke up in a hospital
bed and was undergoing pregnancy induction, and I woke up in an uncomfortable
nook -- not realizing that long restful nights of sleep were gone.  Today, I
woke up on a couch with a six month old sleeping on my belly.

This month was much like [last month][l], he just got better at everything.
His rolling is now a nuisance on the changing table.  His crawling is still
army like and now he gets into stuff or terrorizes the cat.  He bounces up on
all fours.  He can also sit up without support which means we can put him in a
high chair or in a shopping cart.  And that tooth that's been threatening to
emerge since 2.5 months?  It's broken ground.

We did give him an avocado for Thanksigiving and we tried once more on
Saturday, but he (and it may be sheer coincidence) got some redness on his
face, excessive spit-up and sneezing, so we're going to try a new vegetable
later this week.

Here is my son vs a robot:
