title: "Open Source: a Catalyst for Collaboration"
excerpt: I'm going to be working on a paper that will be in no means finished anytime soon regarding Open Source and Collaboration.  It will be targetted towards educators and try to inform them about the Open Source movement.  I'll try to post regarding my progress.  I've only got outlines right now, so I can't offer anybody a preview.
