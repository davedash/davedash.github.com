excerpt: |-
  So yesterday I went to my cousin's engagement party and hung out 
  with Egypt, Su', Tina, Leena, Aradhana, Shiela, and whomever else.  
  It was pretty fun, I guess.  Err.. maybe.  Tina, Leena, Su' 
  and Aradhana had a real good dance (albeit there was a technical 
  difficulty).  Towards the latter part of the night there was dancing, 
  and I hate dancing, but everyone, including my uncle pushed me to go 
  on stage and I made a fool of myself since I have no talent in dancing 
  at all.  Odd that I listen to so much electronica and techno music.  
  <p>
  Afterwards I was conned into going to Woodbury in a van that had way 
  too many people in it.  We (Tina, Leena, Aradhana, Titu, Sunita, &c) 
  stayed at Tina and Leena's main floor.  We stayed up till 5:30 AM or 
  6:00 AM just chatting watching half of Austin Powers, etc.  It was fun 
  It was nice to hang out with people that I hadn't hung with since oh, 
  I dunno... hmm OSA which was in July.  It was also neat meeting someone 
  who's visited my school all the way from Milwaukee twice who is also a 
  clone of Su'.  I learned at 3:00 AM you get hungry and late at night 
  everybody becomes like me... crazy.  That, and people have wierd sleeping habbits, from kicking to enpillowing to talking.  Quite amusing.
  <p>I left around noon.  It was a nice break from being at home and 
  not doing anything substantial.  It's also nice to be with friends that 
  I've known almost all my life.
  <p>Anyway... today Molly and I saw <i>Patch Adams</i>.  I am definitely looking forward to the real Hunter "Patch" Adams visiting Allen Hall in February.  My uncle and his family are coming over tonight.  My little cousin, Joshna is very adorable.  I saw her yesterday, although I never talk to my cousins.  I feel bad, because soon they will be Germans.  
  <p>I don't feel like writing much more tonight.  So bye-bye.
