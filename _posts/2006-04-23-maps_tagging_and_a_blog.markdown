title: Maps, tagging and a blog
excerpt: |-
  I improved a few things with the <a href="http://reviewsby.us/">reviewsby.us site</a>.  The most exciting feature is the home page now features a Yahoo powered map.  The map shows the locations of the latest restaurants.  The GeoRSS feed that powers this will also be retrofitted to power other maps on the site.  You can also subscribe to the GeoRSS feed if you want to for your custom applications.
  
  I also enhanced the way the tagging works a little bit.  The tag-guessing system works fairly well now.
  
  The final enhancement is this blog.  I'll try to keep all the site updates here.
