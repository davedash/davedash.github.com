Yesterday I finally reached that target weight, 159.6 pounds.  If I can maintain this weight, that would put me at a <acronym title="Body Mass Index">BMI</acronym> of 25, which is the border for "Normal weight" and "Overweight."  My goal since sometime last year was to meet or beat this weight.  Judging from my past performance it could take me as long as a few weeks to just over a month to maintain that weight.  Since I know my goal is to be at this weight by June 17th, I'll be putting a lot more effort into continuing to lose weight.

Once the wedding is finished and after firmly nailing down my goal, I'll post a detailed summary of my year of weight loss.  It was easier than I expected to drop the 15-25 pounds.  Also, once this goal is nailed down, I'll come up with a new goal that gets me firmly into the healthy weight category.  Stay tuned.
