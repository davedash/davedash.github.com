title: Killing spree
excerpt: |-
  Despite the seemingly arbitrary killing of 168 people in the Oklahoma bombing, I still find something disconcerting with the execution of McVeigh (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_1321000/1321244.stm">profile</a>).  I think not enough is focussed on his reasons for the bombing.  What McVeigh did was unacceptable and is an inappropriate way to deal with the government, but their was a definite criticism of the US Government that I think should be heard.
  <p>
  McVeigh seemed to be more interested (what I gather from the media) about gun control, and militia-rights.  I just want to know what he was observing.  So I view this whole bombing as a means to silence McVeigh and possibly as some gross form of... revenge that the government is enacting on behalf of the victims' families.
