I've been asked to speak at [SymfonyCamp][s] (`symfony['camp']`) next month (you should all go if you can) and I thought I'd present as well as I could on Ajax and the Zend Framework Bridge (including Zend Search Lucene).

If you're attending the camp and/or would like to hear about these topics please let me know any specific questions you might have about "[symfony][] and Ajax" and "symfony and Zend" and I'll try to address them in my presentations.

If you are unable to go fear not, I'll try to post my notes on this site.
