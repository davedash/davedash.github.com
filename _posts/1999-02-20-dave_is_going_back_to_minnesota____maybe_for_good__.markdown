title: Dave is going back to Minnesota... maybe for good :(
excerpt: |-
  <b>Read this carefully before jumping to conclusions.</b>  Last year over spring break the University of Illinois held a reception for Minnesotan's who were accepted to the U of I.  I went and I decided that I did like this school.  Also present were <a href="http://www.jawed.com/">Jawed Karim</a> and <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/ph/ns.uiuc.edu?Query=davidkam">David Kam</a>.  They were residents of a program called Unit One/Allen Hall.  So I signed up for this, because they made it seem like something I'd be interested in.  This year I met both people and became pretty good friends with Jawed and acquainted with Dave.  Dave is now transferring to the <a href="http://www.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota</a>.  He leaves tomorrow.  I found out about this today, which is somewhat disconcerting.  I don't like it when someone leaves.  It's also someone who made me decide on this hall in particular.
  <p>Today some of 4 North and friends through a party for him.  It was a lot of fun.  We sprayed him down with silly string when he came into the Allen Hall Main Lounge.  We played a game of crab ball which ended up displacing parts of Allen Hall's lounge.  The game was fun nonetheless.  The lounge is a nice place to hang out with a large group of people.  I like it.  At least I'll get to see Dave over break which will be nice.
  <p>Note to Caroline:  I have a ton of more updates that I will do later.  I have a text file of notes, and I have a legal pad filled with journalish entries and whatnot.  It's all going to eventually be ported to the web-journal.  You're still the best.
  <p>Freedom... coming soon this week.
