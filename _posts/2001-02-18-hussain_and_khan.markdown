title: Hussain and Khan
excerpt: |-
  I just got back from an incredible performance by Zakir Hussain and Ali Akbar Khan.  I have nothing more to say, other than it was amazing.  Probably the best Indian music I've ever had the pleasure of listening.
  <p>
  I claim 2000-2001 the school year of the year.  Marc and Dan dropping me off, Marc visiting for a week and the hi-hello from Katie this weekend were all nice touches.  Way to go 2000-2001!
