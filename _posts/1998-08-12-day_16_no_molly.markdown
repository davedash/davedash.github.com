title: Day 16 No Molly
excerpt: I did nothing today.  I would normally not have an entry but then I'd be missing day 16.  What <b>did</b> I do?  Hmm... I woke up later.  I started reading <i>Children of Dune</i>.  It's working thus far.  I've studied more Japanese.  I installed a fan for my hard drive.  I think I'll no longer have to open that case for a while.  At least not until I move.  I noticed temporary no parking signs issued by the Edina police on both my neighbor's lawns... I'm a bit suspicious as to why this is.  I wonder if this is related to friends and acquaintances of mine parking on the street... I hope not, but you never know.  I personally do not care, because I am leaving in a week.  This is my last Wednesday that I will get to spend at my house at least until December.  If any of you are looking for a cheap computer, <a href="http://www.micronpc.com/">Micron</a> has a few refurbished 300MHz machines available with 64MB of RAM.  They are nice machines, except that they are desktop models.  They are about $1K each no monitor.
