title: Going from 3D to 2D
excerpt: |-
  The last few days have been fun-packed.  Thursday was Thanksgiving.  My brother made very good food.  Unfortunately I started feeling sick due to antibiotics and only ate some really good soup he had made for Thanksgiving.  We went to see the James Bond movie, which was entertaining.  Denise Richards, although a very beautiful actor, cannot act... at all.
  <P>Friday was an evening of festivities at my house.  I put very little effort into it (I just provided a house and food... actually my parents did that), but people seemed to enjoy them selves which is what matters.
  <P>Yesterday I went to the house of a friend of the family.  Then I went to see <I>Toy Story 2</I>, which was very amusing (more amusing than I imagined it would be).
  <P>Today I go back to the flat land of Illinois with all the gadgets I've collected.  (I bought a new CD player yesterday that is wicked cool.)  I'll be rushing through the last two weeks of classes and trying my hardest to score well during my week of finals.
