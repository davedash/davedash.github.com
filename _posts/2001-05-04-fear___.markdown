title: Fear...
excerpt: |-
  So I learned a new definition of fear.  Fear out of love.  When we love something or someone so much that to go against it we are afraid.  This new definition helps me understand the term God-fearing.  I always termed myself as God-loving and did things not in fear of God, but in love.  So essentially this new definition settles that.
  <p>
  For a traditional fear though, I fear that people still eat at Shaitan's... or McDonald's.  Nasty stuff... Tejal sent me some <a href="http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/mcds/indiawest090401.html">
  more info</a> on their evil.  Basically, my vegetarian or just non-beef eating friends, French Fries have beef.  If someone would like to be of great service to the Vegetarian, Vegan, Halal communities several certification companies could be set up to certify a restraunt as meeting certain guidelines.  Restaurant and food that is.  I mean, really, how many of you realize that French Fries are beef, and skittles are animal based (potentially)?
