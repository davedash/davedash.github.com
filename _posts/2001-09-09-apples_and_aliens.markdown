title: Apples and Aliens
excerpt: |-
  So yesterday I went to Oyster Fest... that was fun, I guess.  Too many people with too much alcohol that were too angry wanting to move from one position to another.  Anyway they had Alien Ant Farm and Cake, both who were pretty good, but ... I've been to better outdoor concerts.
  <p>
  Anyway, I spilled water on my keyboard twice, and well... the second time pretty much nixed any usability left in my keyboard... sadly Best Buy opened at 11, and low and behold did not have what I was looking for.  So I'm at the Woodfield Mall (a decent mall in Schaumburg) lookng around.  I'm now at an Apple store.  It's not too bad.  The computers are all nice and colored in that ice coloring scheme Apple loves.  I like it too.  Too bad there is just a few things that apple does that makes me not want to get one.  Like worshipping donkeys.... just kidding.  I don't know if they worship donkeys.
