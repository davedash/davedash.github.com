title: Pictures of India
excerpt: |-
  I've developed some of my India pictures, and some pictures from Halloween.  I don't have them all in the picture gallery yet, but if you'd like to see them, I'll give you access to my <a href="http://www.snapfish.com/">Snapfish</a> albums.  Just ask.
  <p>For now, you can look at the <a href="http://davedash.com/pictures">Tunpur pictures</a> that were taken in my family village in Orissa.</p>
