I have a hard time finding good programmers.  Usually I'm asked to look for one in the most inopportune times.  Namely when we're on a tight deadline and it's really too late to add new people.  Unfortunately, it looks like [I'm not alone][ch1] in learning that the programmers for hire aren't up to snuff.

Looking for a [PHP][] developer is worse, because there is such a low barrier to entry.  If you look for a Java developer or a C/C++ developer there's some reasonable assurance that they either *a.* learned it very well or *b.* was taught it formally.  With [PHP][] the barrier to entry is so low that anybody can claim to be a [PHP][] developer.  I can safely attest that if you embark on a quest to learn more about [PHP][] or even programming in general there's a lot more out there.<sup id="fnr-prog1">[1](#fn-prog1)</sup>

I think the best situation is to interview for people during your downtime and keep the communication open with them.  In my situation I know more positions that are open that require talented developers versus the number of talented developers I know.  So even if I can't use a person when they happen to be free, I can at least pass them on good leads.

This subsequently highlighted how much more I don't know yet. <a href="#fnr-prog1" class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote -prog1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></li>
