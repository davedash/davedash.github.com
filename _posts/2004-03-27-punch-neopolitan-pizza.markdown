I took advantage of the 60 degree weather and left work so  and I could try out her new Rollerblades.  It was fun.  Then we went to Punch Neopolitan Pizza - which was delicious.  I highly recommend it, it's $5 per pizza (we had a coupon for buy one get one free).  We got both a Margherita and a Napoli pizza.  The Napoli was the better, in my opinion.  It was more flavorful and the tomatoes on it were nice and fresh tasting. 

It was cool watching them place the pizzas on the wood burning stoves.  So if you're wondering if all those rave reviews were right, I'd say so.
