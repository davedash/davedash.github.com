title: Apple Repairs
excerpt: |-
  So in the last couple of weeks I must have damaged my cd/dvd drive on my TiBook.  Unfortunately that means it needs to be repaired.  Normally when I have to wait on computer like things - it takes FOREVER.  So I took my 'book in Tuesday and didn't expect it back until Monday, and I said, okay, I'll be less anxious and just check on it on Friday.  I called, and Apple said, it's already being delivered.  Sure enough it was actually already delivered to our neighbor's office in the front :)  Can't wait until that Apple Store opens in Southdale.
  
  p.s. I made the switch to non-Windows a long time ago.  Then I switched to Apple, just before it was cool.
