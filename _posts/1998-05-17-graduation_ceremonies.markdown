title: Graduation Ceremonies
excerpt: I remember people asking why we were not having the Hopkins High School graduations at Northrup Auditorium.  They claimed that Northrup was under remodelling.  Suzy said that they were painting the basement.  Either way, it was irrelevant.  The day we graduate, 11 June.  Is when <a href="mailto:adame@ftmax.com">Adam Engelhart</a> and the rest of Eden Prairie High School have their graduation ceremonies at the Northrup.  Just another reason why I hate our school.
