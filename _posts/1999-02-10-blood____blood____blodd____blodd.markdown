title: Blood... blood... blodd... Blodd?
excerpt: |
  
  
  Well the other day my roommate was talking in his sleep... in English.  He said "hey Josh" a couple times.  It was pretty funny.  Maybe he thought he could get in a game of <i>Tekken</i> or something.
  
  <p>Jack always thinks that if the volume is at 15 that I can function as if it wasn't on.  That's flawed reasoning.  He uses 15 because I guess once I was typing up something at that level.  Well whatever, I don't think he understands that the other component of the "I hate TV" equation is that his TV has this high pitched noise to it.  A lot of old or cheap TVs have this sound to it.  It's somewhat irritating.  That's why I like computer monitors.  They don't emit such an awful sound.
  
  <p>I had this terrible headache that cut my productivity down a good deal.  So I was listening to <i> Selected Ambient Works vol. 2</i> which was remarkably soothing.  So yeah, go buy it next time you have a headache.
  
  <p>My friend Karl has pointed out that I don't go to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/>cnn.com</a> often.  I guess some King died and he's just pointing out that nobody knows anything beyond their own region's problems in America.  He's right.
  
  <p>Ever been to <a href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/">Matt's Script Archive?</a>  I used to go there a few years ago to use scripts like the BBS we had on mightycow.com a long time ago.  I read the page about <a href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/mattw/">Matt Wright</a> a while back, maybe last year or the year before.  I thought nothing of it.  But if you read the page you'll realize he goes to the U of I.  I found this out when Anand told me, "Matt Wright is awesome at Perl."  "Who's that?  Wait, is that Matt's Script Archive Matt?"  "Yeah, also the Matt who lives on our floor."  So yeah, next time you go to Matt's Script Archive, remember, I know this guy.  He's also <a href="http://www.jawed.com/">Jawed</a>'s roommate.  Two computer geniuses in one room...
