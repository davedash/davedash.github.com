excerpt: |-
  Apparently Molly saw <i>Can't Hardly Wait</i> twice.  That's very odd.  
  
  <p>Marc says I need to pull my grades up, so I will attempt that this semester.  I'll need to practice (almost spelled it practis) cliches like "study smarter, not harder."
  <p>I've got one friend that sends me all these forwards.  Some of them are okay, some of them are downright annoying.  My biggest complaint is all that crap that has nothing to do with the message, like the email addresses that it was sent to and stuff.  I wish people would delete all the things that said "so and so wrote on this date..." and who previous people sent the message too.  It's less stuff to scroll through.
  <p>Hey, the impeachment trial is on the cover of CBC's news page.  America rocks, we're so important that our impeachment trial is the main thing on the <a href="http://www.cbcnews.cbc.ca/">CBC's page</a>.  We rock.
  <p>Lucent bought Ascend.  I knew someone who worked for Ascend.  I know people who work for Lucent.  I know people who have Lucent phones.  Look at me, I'm so cool, I know all these people.  I've got phones!
  <p>Today I went to eat at some Greek/Mediterranean restaurant on 394.  The food wasn't all too bad, not exactly a college student type restaurant.  I had something that had spinach.  Now all I smell is spinach.
