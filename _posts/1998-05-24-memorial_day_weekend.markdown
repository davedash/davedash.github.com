  Some people died for something.

Friday we went to see <a href="http://www.godzilla.com/">Godzilla</a> (or Gozira).  It was a very good movie if you expect an action movie.  After that we went to Tanya's and played Boggle.  That night or maybe the next morning I stumbled upon a good <a href="http://www.playsite.com/">game web site.</a><p>Saturday Adam came over.  I got my hair cut and I thought I looked a lot like my brother (it's all spiked), but no, today my brother cut his hair too and it's really short.  Adam and I started moving stuff around my room.  If you've ever been in here, I changed the desks around again.  It's very spacious in here if you are working on office stuff.<p>
  We were midway moving stuff and Molly came over and we went to Hyland Park in Bloomington (based on my directions).  We played Tag, it was fun.  <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ywong/">Yishan</a> had some ailment that caused him to be lying on a picnic table while people poked him with ray guns.<p>After that Adam and I moved more stuff then went to Arby's with Marc, Mike and Molly.  After that Adam and I moved the rest of the stuff and everyone else played Dr. Mario.  At midnight everyone left.  Adam Marc and I stayed up until 2 and then we slept woke up around 8.  Adam and Marc picked up some pancake stuff and they made pancakes while I finished cleaning my room.<p>A lot of people went to Taylor Falls.  I don't have rock climbing gear and wouldn't feel comfortable going rock climbing with all these people who are probably many times better than I.<p>I went to a Barbecue with my brother, sister-in-law, Mom2, Mandy and a few other people.  The food was good.<p>Now I will learn how to do some stupid programming project.
