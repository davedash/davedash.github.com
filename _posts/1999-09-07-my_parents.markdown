title: My Parents
excerpt: |-
  My parents visited me this Saturday.  It was nice.  I ate good food and slept in a nicely airconditioned hotel.  I'm almost 20.
  <P>
  The Dead Can Dance broke up last year.  I found that out today.  That makes me sad, because I love their music.  Supposedly they are working on Solo Projects.  Which is good, because I think they are both very talented.  Dead Can Dance makes me face the day every morning.  Dead Can Dance and Allegra.  Allegra helps me not sneeze so often.
  <P>I'm okay.  Better than okay.
