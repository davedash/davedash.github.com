Yesterday Katie, Adam and I walked to "Our Kitchen."  A tiny little breakfast hole on Bryant and 36th.  Definitely a good place for cheap breakfast.

Katie and I are going to continue our weekly/bi-weekly breakfast outings around the Twin Cities.  By bi-weekly I mean every two weeks, not twice a week as it can also mean... wierd.

Woo-hoo, made it to work early!  It's kinda nice when nobody's around and there's light outside ;)  Off to a meeting...
