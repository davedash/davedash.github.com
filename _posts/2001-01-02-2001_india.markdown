excerpt: |-
  This break wasn't my best of breaks.  I didn't get the gifts I wanted for the end of year gift exchange extravaganza.  I didn't do to much.
  <p>
  However, a good friend of mine said this, "You have an interesting life."  Reflecting on that makes me feel better.  No, I don't feel like my life is that interesting.  If it were, I could tell great stories about my life.  I'm not a good storyteller.  But at least one person said that my life was interesting.  Maybe it's because I do things.
  </p><p>I for the first time will be travelling solo to another country.  That in itself, I have no problem with.  What makes it an adventure is that I am going to India.  I know a smidge of Hindi and I'm winging it by myself for the first time.  Undeveloped country... should be a blast.  So I am excited.  This is my little adventure.  I'm taking rolls of film, and hopefully they will show up on this web site:)
  </p><p>Hope everyone else is having fun.</p>
