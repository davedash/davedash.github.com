So i had an awesome time with my favorite brother and sister-in-law in Tampa and Kissimee Florida.  Definitely a great vacation, nice weather, plenty of stuff to do and see and quite relaxing.<!--more-->I spent a few days over at Aunt Edie's, we had Christmas there with every body.  I got to meet a lot of Kelly's extended family (and therefore my super-extended family).  It was fun.

Around Kissimee we stayed at a nice timeshare/resort.  We visited Splendid China which is this great outdoor mini-China which had all these miniature replicas of Chinese architecture.  

We also went to Silver Springs to see a wild animals and underwater fun with a glass bottomed boat.

I think the best attraction we visited, however, was the Kennedy Space Center.  It totally renewed my interest in Space and science.

So anyway yeah, it was a lot of fun.  I intend to go back to warmer climates every winter.  Screw cold.
