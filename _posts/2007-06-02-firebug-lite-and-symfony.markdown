[tags]Firefox, symfony, firebug, firebug lite[/tags]

I wrote a [symfony plugin to enable the Firebug Lite javascript](http://trac.symfony-project.com/trac/wiki/sfFirebugLitePlugin) in your [symfony][] app (in much the same way that `web_debug` works).

Firebug, Gmail Manager and Adblock are all plugins I use regularly in Firefox.  However, I've been getting tired of Firefox's hunger for my resources, so I want to be as browser independent as possible.  So this plugin allows me (and you) to embed some of the debugging functionality of Firebug in other browsers.
