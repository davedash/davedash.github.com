title: freedom for a time
excerpt: All five of my classes in the last two and a half weeks have had midterms.  I had my last one tonight (Hindi) and it was fairly simple.  So now I have some free time.  Actually I don't.  I didn't really study too much for those tests (I just did my best, which was pretty good).  Now, I just have a computer architecture machine problem (MP) and two homework assignments to finish by Monday.  Luckily the work portion of the MP is complete.
