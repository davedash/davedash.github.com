title: Taj Mahal and Hindu Zionism
excerpt: The Taj Mahal was vandalized yesterday.  [ <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2001/10/15/top17.htm">the Dawn Group</a> ][ <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/oct/14bjp.htm">Rediff India</a> ].<p>I've been watching this slow pattern of visible anti-Muslim rhetoric spewed by the BJP/RSS/VHP (unholy trinity that acts in the name of Hindusim).  It's out of hand, and if India wants to stay a true republic for all people Muslim and Hindu alike, it will need to change the climate.</p>

The Taj Mahal was vandalized yesterday.  [ <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2001/10/15/top17.htm">the Dawn Group</a> ][ <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/oct/14bjp.htm">Rediff India</a> ].<p>I've been watching this slow pattern of visible anti-Muslim rhetoric spewed by the BJP/RSS/VHP (unholy trinity that acts in the name of Hindusim).  It's out of hand, and if India wants to stay a true republic for all people Muslim and Hindu alike, it will need to change the climate.</p><!--more-->India is on the verge of turning into a racist state that abuses its religious and racial minorities like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Israel.  Right now its in the hands of a signle party, the BJP.<p>The BJP has remarkable similarities to the National Socialist party of 1930s Germany.  Given the chance they'd remove any remnants of the Islamic period of India - including the 14% Muslim population.</p><p>I'm being harsh and extreme, but it is deserved.  This is not the Gandhiesque Indians, these are not the open minded Hindus, these are extremists who defile Hinduism by claiming all Islam and foreign cultures as an enemy to it.</p><p>This offends me to no end as an Indian American.  The Taj Mahal is one of the greatest monuments of India.  The wonderful intermixing of Hindus and Muslims is a beauty.  I strive to understand Islam and relate it to the teachings my family has passed onto me.  It is remarkably similar.  If only the extremists would realize this.  </p><p>They cannot blame Islam for the terror in Kashmir.  True - many Islamic groups have committed acts of terror in Kashmir - but we as Indians must accept our acts of terror, our occupation in India.  The moral high ground will always win.</p>
