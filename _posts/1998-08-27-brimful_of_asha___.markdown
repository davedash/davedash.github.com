title: Brimful of Asha...
excerpt: |-
  I talked to her again... luckily we are so techno-savvy that we will find a way not to spend nearly as much money as Dan and Amy do on long distance.<p>
  <i>Brimful of Asha</i> is a great song.  I think I like it a lot just because the one guy from the band is from India, and thus there are a ton of Indian references.<p>
  Today Heather, Brian and I went on a Hot Air Balloon ride.  It was mostly going up ten feet and coming down.  It wasn't all that great.
