  I guess Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0b2 was not supposed to be announced to the world like <a href="http://www.betanews.com/">BetaNews</a> did.  Luckily, I installed it before Microsoft did anything.  I should probably redownload it for a better build, but I don't care that much.  Beta 2 fixed my shortcut/shares and other miscellaneuous icon problems.  It installed smoothly (smoother than any other IE, that I can remember).  It's worth upgrading to if you have 5.0B1 otherwise don't bother, it may not be worth the hassle.
  <p>My mom sent a signed affadavit (actually my dad signed it) for my netcam.  I forecast that I will get it around the middle of December at the latest.  She also sent a package via <a href="http://www.airborne-express.com/">Airborne Express</a> filled with Candy. :)
  <p>
  I'm voting for senator Mosely-Braun, the incumbant.  It was between her (Democrat) or Jim Davis (Natural Law Party).  The Republican candidate didn't fill out this election survey, the libertarian and the US Taxpayer both annoyed me.  The Reform party was okay.  I agreed with a lot of what Mosely-Braun and Davis had to say, but Braun was a little bit better in most issues.  I'll decide on whom else I should vote for later.  I'll probably default to Democrat or Natural Law Party (because they are a promising third party with many views akin to mine).
  <p>My song of the week is Juno Reactor's <i>Feel the Universe (Kox Box remix)</i>... I'll upload <i>Feel the Universe</i> to the MP3 server of choice.  It prompted me to download more Juno Reactor and more Kox Box and other Techno MP3s I could dig up.  It's funny, I tend to always have more Techno MP3s than the MP3 server.  Even after uploading all I have, I end up finding more stuff.
  <ul><li>I ran today (Friday)... out of assumed necessity.  It was nice.<li>The web site for <a href="http://www.maximumpcmag.com/">Maximum PC</a> is finally online.  I think it will be equivilant to the other computer sites I visit, but who knows.<li>Hate Microsoft, Love Linux?  See <a href="http://www.kmfms.com/">this</a>.<li>Look at <a href="http://www.zapme.com/home.html">this</a>.  I fully expect that this site would use mouseovers (the buttons change when you put your mouse over them).  Strange.
