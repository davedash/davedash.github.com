title: First Day at UIUC
excerpt: |
  Thursday I could really tell that I had friends.  Adam helped me the whole day with packing.  Mike Jorgenson and Marc helped me throughout the day by keeping me company and Katie joined us for dinner.  We marveled at how neat it was that we made a very good meal buy ourselves (well actually Marc and Katie made a good meal).
  <p>
  So I ended my traditional life as a Minnesotan resident that night.  I barely slept.  Tried to catch up on reading and packing.  We left at about six in the morning on Friday.  The ride was pretty fast.  We made a slight mistake that cost us 20 miles or so.  We arrived at Allen Hall at 3 PM.
  <p>
  My brother and I with some help quickly loaded my boxes of stuff into my room.  We went shopping for a refrigerator and a microwave.  Then we ate food at a Steak and Shake.  We came to my room and loaded all my new stuff inside.  We set up everything as much as we could and then my brother left.  It's was disconcerting to part with the one person who was always looking out for your best interests for your entire life.
  <p>
  I went to the orientation night activities.  It was there that I met Heather, my neighbor who lives down the hall.  She's a cool person who hails from Omaha, Nebraska.  I skipped out on the movie and decided to hang out with Heather, and explain to her some things about her computer.  I felt very Adamish.  I talked her into housing my IBC rootbeer collection for the night as well.
  <p>
  I found some guy who knows as much about computers as I do who was also the network guy for our hall.  Luckily he's on my floor.  He picked up the cable I needed to connect to the Ethernet.  Unfortunately I was too incompetent to get DHCP up until Saturday (Day 26) afternoon.  I also met Brian, my neighbor who doesn't like to walk.
  <p>I woke up in the middle of the night and decided to sleep on the bottom bunk since my roommate is not yet here.  That worked.  I woke up and had enough time to get ready before day orientation stuff started but had to skip out on breakfast.  I met Stefan Pfister during lunch.  Stefan went to my Jr. High and Highschool.  We ate lunch and went to a bunch of orientation sessions together.  We later met up with Heather and went book shopping.  Books are expensive.
  <p>
  Stefan and I went to eat at the Luau but ate inside instead of outside, since the inside has AC.  We skipped the rest of it, because weren't into dancing and stuff.  We hung out watched south park I saw his room.  I later went to my room and attempted to sleep or clean up my room or something.<p>
  9 PM rolled along and when I popped downstairs Stefan caught me and asked me if I wanted to see <i>Blade</i>.  I ran upstairs and got Brian and we all saw it.  The movie was very cool.  Oh yeah, sometime that day I gained a roommate.
  <p>
  I had a tremendous sleep-deprived headache which is still persisting.  I had trouble sleeping more than a few hours last night as well.  I have to talk my roommate into reconfiguring the air flow of this room.  I ended up showering and going to the basement where it's cooler and hung out.  I later decided hanging out won't cut it.  I slept.  Some janitor guy pitied me.
  <p>
  I went upstairs and decideded to finish some things.  Then I went downstairs for brunch with Brian.  We met this girl Mary who has a baton.  She's one of those people who fares well solo.
  <p>Brian and I made an excursion to Walgreens and some other place to get some stuff we needed.  It was hot and annoying outside.
  <p>Not much else has happened today.  This weekend has been pretty good so far.  I like it.  I just need a new telephone and a large fan.  I should shave my head and put heatsinks on it.  It's neat being from anywhere other than Chicago, or for that matter any place not Illinois.
