title: Spam...
excerpt: |
  Spam just keeps sinking to all new lows.  For those of you who do not know, Spam is unwanted email that is sent to people on mailing lists.  Essentially it's junk e-mail.  It's many times more frustrating than junk mail because the companies who use spam don't have to actually pay to do it and it makes an efficient means of communication (email) a mess.  Companies usually advertise porn sites or get rich quick schemes.  Anyway, the latest spam I recieved simply explains how to remove yourself from the bulk-mailing list.  Basically you email your address somewhere or fill out a form and... well they don't take you off anything.  They put you on another list.
