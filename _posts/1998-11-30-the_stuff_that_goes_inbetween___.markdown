title: The stuff that goes inbetween...
excerpt: |
  These are <a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/">chronologically</a> out of whack, due to ... I don't know... <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Recreation/Games/Video_Games/Classic_Arcade_Games/Titles/Space_Invaders/">space aliens</a>.  Space aliens said, Travel Logs and then the vacation...
  <p><b><tt>Tuesday:</tt></b><br>
  I had dinner with my family at some restaurant.  We got to ride in Raj (my brother) and Kelly's (sister-in-law) new <a href="http://www.saab.com/">Saab</a>.  I like it.  
  <p><b><tt>Wednesday:</tt></b><br>
  I had an eye appointment and a dental appointment.  I like my hygenists, because they aren't ugly.  The only reason this matters to me is because I'd rather have a pretty hygenist sticking her fingers in my mouth than an ugly one.  That night I went with <a href="mailto:dash@mninter.net">Raj</a> and Kelly to see <i><a href="http://www.movies.com/eos/">Enemy of the State</a></i>
  also present were <a href="mailto:katie@ftmax.com">Katie</a> and <a href="mailto:dlavenda@yahoo.com">Daniel</a> and later I guess <a href="mailto:tenchi@ftmax.com">Marc</a>, <a href="mailto:jesse@ftmax.com">Jesse</a> and <a href="http://umn.edu/~zhux0045/">Tanya</a> arrived.  I liked the movie a lot.  It's great if you like spy stuff and technology.  I started getting this headache that bothered me into Thanksgiving.  I also had a cold the entire time I was there (I'm still fighting it).
  <p><b><tt>Thursday:</tt></b><br>Something was wierd with this year's Thanksgiving.  I think that the normal excitement of Thanksgiving was dulled with me just being back... and the party on Friday.  Our Thanksgiving movie was <i><a href="http://www.disney.com/DisneyPictures/bugslife/">Bug's Life</a></i>.  Another excellent <a href="http://www.pixar.com/">Pixar</a> doing.

  I lost my black knife.  <a href="mailto:gut@ftmax.com">Marc</a> found it and is now keeping it until I come back.  The party, however, was great.  It was nice to see all my friends.  People seem to be the same.  Well some people look different.  I'll post some of the pictures that <a href="mailto:dalamar@ftmax.com">Mike Jorgenson</a> took.  We watched <i><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Better+Off+Dead...+(1985)">Better off Dead</a></i> since a lot of people had not seen it yet.  Jason brought his <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/">N64</a> and <a href="http://www.zelda64.com/">Zelda</a> (gold cartridge) it looked pretty.  <a href="mailto:katie@ftmax.com">Katie</a> managed to find my old red knife, for which I thank <a href="mailto:katie@ftmax.com">her</a>.  <i>Freakazoid</i> was enjoyed by <a href="mailto:gut@ftmax.com">Marc</a>, <a href="mailto:katie@ftmax.com">Katie</a>, <a href="http://www.ftmax.com/" target=_self>myself</a> and maybe others.  I was very unsocial, usually confining myself to conversations with <a href="mailto:katie@ftmax.com">Katie</a> or <a href="mailto:gut@ftmax.com">Marc</a>.  I think I would have enjoyed the party if I didn't feel so blah.
  <p><b><tt>Saturday:</tt></b><br>
    I tried to finish my math assignment on Saturday.
  <p>All and all, I think it was a good thing to have the break.  I would have enjoyed it a bit more if I weren't sick, if <a href="mailto:delmonte@ftmax.com">Molly</a> were there, if I did more stuff with my friends, or if it were longer.  Saturday was somewhat distressing.  I tried to cope with getting over constantly working all the time during school.
