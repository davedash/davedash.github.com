title: "Despite your chewy goodness, your made of Blue #2"
excerpt: "Linux and all it's goodness couldn't save my damn journal entry that I typed.  Good think I ICQed the bulk of it to my sidekick of love at Caltech.\r\n\
  <p>\r\n\
  Wednesday I went with <a href=\"http://www.engelbot.com/\">Adam</a> to <a href=\"http://www.math.umn.edu/~shaw/\">Dr. Shaw</a>'s math class featuring Aaron Engelhart and \"Little\" Dan Jay-Dixon.  Adam and I quickly learned Differential Equations again and became TAs.\r\n\
  <p>Later we went to Middlebrook Hall and visited Dave Weiler and Marc, then Dan with \r\n\
  no Jesse and then Zach and Jason with Clint and later a Becky and then we broke into Marc's room and took our\r\n\
  jackets and left.\r\n\
  <p>Then I returned my Meat Beat Manifesto CD at cheapo. =(  Note to people.  Cheapo doesn't like giving Cash Refunds.  They say they will give Cash Refunds but that is crap.  I got one because they made an exception.  They are perfectly fine with giving gift-certificates.  Once they have your money, they want to keep it.  I wouldn't have cared if they gave me a gift certificate, except that I don't go to Cheapo that often to buy things.  I could, I guess have given it to Marc, who probably shops at Cheapo more than I.\r\n\
  <p>So yeah, I did stuff that day.\r\n\
  <p><a href=\"http://www.christiangallery.com/atrocity/\">This</a> might disgust most of you... <a href=\"http://www.christiangallery.com/atrocity/\">it</a> disgusts me.  I can understand not liking Abortion for some moral reasons, but to kill a fellow citizen because of a view that you have that others may not subscribe to is sickening.\r\n\
  <p>I finally finished the year end <i>Science</i> journal.  Once I got to the research paper section of the magazine, it went downhill.  I mean, even if I was interested... research papers are boring as all hell.\r\n\
  <p>You know Veruca Salt?  Yeah well she or it or whatever has this remake of Depeche Mode's song <i>Sombody</i>... but I mean... now it sounds all lesbian if you listen to <a href=\"http://search.lyrics.ch/query/get?s=27943\">the words</a>... it's kinda funny.  \"All lesbian.\"  That's funny.  \r\n\
  <p>Slashdot presented me with this <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_250000/250343.stm\">link</a>.  For all you cat lovers out there, here's technology acting out blasphemey.  It's about this cat that learns based on its surroundings.  Supposedly the brain for this will have the largest neural network.  Now you know why Data from Star Trek always liked cats. "
