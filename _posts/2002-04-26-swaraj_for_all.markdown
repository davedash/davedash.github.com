title: Swaraj for all
excerpt: |-
  The more I read about the history of my people, the more it motivates me that I too must live up to the standards they have set.  Our cruel British
  masters who put us through the worst living hell gave rise to a strong movement for the Indian people.  True desi nationalism.  Nationalism in
  the sense of self-rule, Swaraj.  Why do so many Indians in this country stay quiet?  Whatever... at least I haven't forgotten to struggle.

I will fight until the bitter end.  Peace means nothing without justice and equality.  Peace needs to be for everyone.  We get off too easily in this country.
