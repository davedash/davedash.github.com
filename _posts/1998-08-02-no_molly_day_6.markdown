title: No Molly Day 6
excerpt: |-
  Today I missed her.<p>
  I read a lot of <i>Dune</i>.  I like it a lot.  Today I cleaned my room further.  In the early AM I was working heavily on the new site.  I hope to get around to adding everything by the end of this week.  I almost helped this girl get a notebook, but actually just tricked her to going to Best Buy when it was closed.<p>Today I went to the They Might Be Giants concert which was at the Hops festival.  It was very very cool.  I missed Molly.  Perhaps it's because I love going to concerts with her (even though I've done so only twice).  We just always have fun.  This would have been especially better because we got to listen to someone for free.  I am, however, home now, so I don't mind as much.  We got very wet.  They played a lot of songs, including new ones.  I was somewhat hoping for them to play <i>She's an Angel</i>.  No such luck.
