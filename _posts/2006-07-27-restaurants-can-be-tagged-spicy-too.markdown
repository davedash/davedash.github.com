We had a change of heart on tagging.  Tag everything!  Initially I felt that only menu items should be tagged.  "People want to know [what dishes are spicy][r1]"... true, but people also want to know what restaurants are in [Uptown] or are [Mexican] or are [closed on mondays][com].  So... we now have restaurant tags.  [Login] and tag something!
