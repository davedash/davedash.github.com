title: Jack's messages
excerpt: |-
  Again, I wake up and no Jack.  The difference?  I woke up at 7PM (naturally with no alarm clock).  He came back within a half hour or an hour.<p>Here's the funny thing Jack did.  When you read it you will know the what the funny thing Jack did was.  Today, I've motivated myself to go researching after dinner and when I came back around 8PM.  Jack wakes up when I enter the room and turn on the light.  There were 6 identical phone numbers on the Caller ID display and another that was from out of town.  I'm assuming from the phone outside Allen Hall/Unit One Housingplex (sounds better than Residence Hall).  I check my messages.  Jack realizes the time and waits until I finish my message check and he checks his messages.  Then he says, "Bullshit... my mom called at 7:34 PM."  Well actually his Mom called at 7:34, 7:38, 7:51, 7:54, 8:00, 8:16.  He slept through all six phone rings.  He asked, "Where were you?"  I told him I was at the library until now (then sometime after 8:16PM).<p>As the <a href="http://www.chick.com/">Chick tracts</a> would say, "Poor stupid Jack, you'll never get into heaven if you sleep all day."  Well Jack is finally gone.  Not forever, but for the rest of the week.<p>Here is a quote to motivate "all y'all:"<blockquote>
  We have now progressed in our thinking about giftedness and realise the static nature of our previous approach.  Giftedness does not refer to something that is fixed for life but, rather, to a dynamic quality that is <i>influenced</i> over time.  We do not seek to identify a fixed reservoir of ability and to calculate an ability score but rather to <i>nurture</i> and <i>develop</i> abilities to a higher level of performance.<p>-Eddie J. Braggettof Charles Sturt University:
  in "a developmental concept of giftedness: implications for the regular
  classroom"</blockquote>
  This is the type of stuff that interests me and takes up my precious time at the education library and speech class.
