excerpt: |-
  Erin called me a pervert.  I'm not a pervert.  Aside from that, Erin, have a nice day today.
  <P>Scott is not here this week.  I miss Scott.  Nobody to talk to... over the wireless.  Nobody with whom to hang out at Hall Council.
  <P>Brendon will never make it as a nomad.  He will die in the desert.
  <P>This entry was about three people -  Erin, Scott and Brendon.  Therefore it is brought to you by the letters E, S, B and 3.  3 is E.  Erin is mine.
