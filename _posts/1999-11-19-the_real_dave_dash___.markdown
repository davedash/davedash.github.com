title: The real Dave Dash...
excerpt: |-
  This is the real Dave Dash.  Packing up to go home tomorrow.  It's tricky, because I'm packing very little that I won't just leave behind.  Most of it is stuff that I don't want anymore like clothing, etc.  I've begun the apartment search, although it seems a bit late in the game, I think my friend Adam, and I will find a decent four bedroom apartment that will suffice.
  <P>Tomorrow I leave here at about 7 in the morning.  I should be home in the afternoon.  Email me before I leave if you want something more specific.
