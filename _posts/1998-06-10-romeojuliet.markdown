title: Romeo+Juliet
excerpt: I'm recording <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Romeo+%2B+Juliet+(1996)">Romeo + Juliet</a>, the movie nobody likes.  I saw the first 5-10 minutes of it and thought it was cool.  I saw Tybalt and thought... That's gotta be John Leguizamo.  He is so damn funny.  Looks like I graduate tomorrow.  I'm cleaning my room, it's fun.  I take stuff that looks out of order and lay it on the floor.  Then I put things on the floor where they belong.
