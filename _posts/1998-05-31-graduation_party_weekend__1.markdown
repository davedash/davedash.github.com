title: "Graduation Party Weekend #1"
excerpt: |-
  Yesterday: We went to Mychal Anderson's Grad Party.  That was fun.  Later we went to Arthur's Birthday Party.  That was fun.  Then the lights went out after a transformer was jolted by an almighty god.  When I went home, our lights were out too... and as far as I can tell they are still out.  I didn't care too much, becuase it was sunny.  Now it's dark and I have retreated to the Borcherts (one of many homes that have electricity, but the only one that had a computer to spare... must work on assignment).<p>
  Went to Eve's today for Eve Xin and Lisa Alholm's Grad party.  That was fun too.  Well I don't want to say anything more yet, because I should be busy.
