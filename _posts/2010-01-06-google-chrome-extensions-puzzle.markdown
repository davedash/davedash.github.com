I went to Add-on-Con some weeks back to represent my employer, the Mozilla Corporation.

One of the goodies you get as a registrant was a jigsaw puzzle from the Google Chrome Extensions team.

Perfect, my wife and I love solving jigsaw puzzles.  We finally finished a few days ago.  Anybody who has started at all will realize the puzzle is of a QR-code.  The QR-code is an extension that will eventually lead you to a prize.  It was a bit of a mini-puzzle not nearly as difficult as finding the QR code.

Although finding a QR code scanner was a bit difficult, I had to borrow a HTC Magic from [Justin Scott](http://fligtar.com/) and installed a decent barcode scanner.
