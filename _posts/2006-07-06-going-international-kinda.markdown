Some of the first non-Minnesotan restaurants to show up were [Flying Dog](http://reviewsby.us/restaurant/flying-dog), [Bangalore](http://reviewsby.us/restaurant/bangalore) and [Konstam](http://reviewsby.us/restaurant/konstam)... all of them outside the US.  Wasn't expecting that... but then again, I wasn't really surprised.

I finally updated our location tables to account for different countries.  Currently it'll only plot what it can Geocode, and relies exclusively on Yahoo! for GeoCoding.

I've only tested this with a Canadian restaurant.  Hopefully it'll work elsewhere soon.  If anybody plans on adding any non-US, non-Canadian restaurants, let me know if you can figure out how to GeoCode things properly.

Also, I'm pleased as punch that the map on the homepage shows three states as having recent restaurants.  Rock on!
