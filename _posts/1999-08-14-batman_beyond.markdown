title: Batman Beyond
excerpt: |-
  <i>Batman Beyond</i> has got to be the coolest cartoon I've ever seen.  I've always been a fan of Batman.  I liked the original TV show the original movie (but not the sequels) and the cartoon was amazing.  <I>Batman Beyond</I> propels that feeling of amazement.
  <P><I>Batman Beyond</I> takes place in the future.  Batman is some kid that Bruce Wayne found who kicks a lot of ass.  This new Batman improves on the old one with a few things.  Namely techno.  They have a lot of Quake II (Sonic Mayhem)/Chemical Brothers sounding techno (I can swear that some of them are songs that have been muddled up slightly).
  <P>It also features cool weaponry, fighting and villians.  The villians aren't all generic and stupid like some of them in the Batman series.  The intro is very cool and dramatic.  My main problem with the show is the soap-opera sounding commercial transitions... oh well.
