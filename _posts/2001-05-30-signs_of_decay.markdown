title: Signs of Decay
excerpt: |-
  Already, the site is starting to show some signs of decay (I had trouble deleting an entry).  Oh well.  With no internet connection to my house, it might be a while until I fix it.
  <p>
  So last weekend I went to my wonderful home of Minnesota.  I always wondered about people who chose to live in a certain locale.  I mean, for me, I could live anywhere in the world... or so I thought.  Then I went to see my brother's newest property in Uptown (Mpls).  Wow!  I think I know where I want to live.  Obviously my brother and sister-in-law do as well.  It's such a wonderful part of city, and nothings too far from anything.  I seriously may consider living out there for some time.  [I can rollerblade all through Uptown!!!]
  </p>
  <p>
  Not much happening here in Schaumburg at Motorola Labs.  Life is starting to get routine.  Luckily there are good friends who may (insha'allah) visit as well as good books abound.
  </p>
  <p>
  So if anybody wants to help me get a drivers license, let me know :)  Normally I wouldn't care, but that's because I'm normally at school.  Living in this hellhole of suburbia (in a nice apartment, but...) does not work for the carless much more the license-less.
