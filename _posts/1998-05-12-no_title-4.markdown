title: Calendars
excerpt: Well, I surprised myself again.  The Calendar algorithm was very very simple to figure out.  It pretty much uses the same type of logic as anybody would if they were to make an HTML calendar by hand.  So, I wrote this thing, now I have to do something else... yes, I need to write an interface that lets you add/modify/remove events (do you know how annoying it is to write something like that... oh well).<p>It'll be nice when the whole web site is finished.  I take it nobody has been able to find it's location.  It's fairly easy.  Tom probably has the best chance of finding out where it is located.<p>I'll post a time line for the entire site's completion, so you people can have a good idea about what I am doing and when I'm doing it.  I'd give it a good month or two... although I'd like it done at the end of the month.<p>Mike Jorgenson has been in town, Molly and I had lunch with him at UNOs.  UNOs makes great Pizza.  I tried eating a slice of the leftovers and I was full... I have another half slice to go.  Then I remember, you can never eat more than two slices of UNO pizza.<p>Yishan should be back sometime tonight.  I won't eat at UNOs with him, because I can't eat there more than once a month or once every two months.
