  The <a href="http://www.sgi.com/peripherals/flatpanel/">monitor that I desire</a> was featured in an ad for Southpark.  Those creators are cool.  I knew they used an O2, I didn't know they bought the coolest monitor for it.  Somebody buy me this monitor.  Once it drops to around $1K, I'm game for buying it:)
  
  <p>Guess <a href="http://www.pair.com/pair/postcards/summer98/">which post card I sent in</a> to pair Networks.
  
  <p>I had a cool dream on my beanbag last night... I guess for some reason my dorm was somewhere else, it was like a warehouse type place, the rooms were much larger.  Anyway, I went outside of the building and decided I'd be back really soon so I could just leave the door shut, not locked.  I come back and Jack is in the room and I see stuff is moved around and I don't see my computer... none of it.  I ask Jack and he says he doesn't know where it is.  So it was stolen.  Well for some reason I just find an IBM Laptop, but I am still worried about my computer, because I was working on a paper or something and well it was stolen, which sucks.  So I guess I tell my brother that it's been stolen and we end up like seeing these boxes of stuff and we look at it, and I guess one of them has my machine in it.  We had to mark it so they wouldn't get rid of it, and then we eventually got it back I guess.  I wondered about my monitor as well.  I explained why it was my fault, but my brother understood.  Well I just thought it was really strange.  If you ever want to make someone really worried.  Steal their computer.  
  
  <p>Since this is such a geek entry, Apple is coming out with an iMac Notebook.  You could save yourself the money and just buy an Etch and Sketch.
  
  <p>I purchased a new HEPA air filter as advised by my brother.  Supposedly it is shooting out air that will make it easy for me to breathe... we'll see.  I also bought this watch band that cost me a fourth of what my watch cost.  Although, my watch looks like it's brand new, which is nice.
  
  <p>Apparently the Illini Precision Dance Team was selling "Tuck Ins" for $2-$5 last week.  They tuck you in bed, read you a story and kiss you goodnight.  I find this odd.  Actually it said packages from $2-$5.  It's like a prostituion ring, in training.
  
  <p>Sunday I was very sick.  I don't know what I had, but it forced me to sleep most of the day.  Monday I was still sick and forced myself to do a paper.  After finishing my math final I walked home and I was very very cold.  I was shivering.  This was with three layers.  I came back to my hall and my temperature returned to normal.  Today I feel much better.
