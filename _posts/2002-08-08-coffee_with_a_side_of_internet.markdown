title: Coffee with a side of Internet
excerpt: So my first big project is setting up wireless networks at the a few coffee shops.  I've got two people who are pretty much ready to go along with this idea.  It'll be exciting.  You'll be able to walk into a coffeeshop and open your laptop and be online.  We're also thinking of hardwired lines too... more on this later.
