Timothy Wise always manages to write something that might interest me.  Here's <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=11833">something on dissenters</a>.<!--more-->It's amazing that people think that I am for letting the terrorists go (or worse that I am in support of the terrorists) simply because I choose to question the acceptability of fighting "fire with fire."  I'm heavily influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and Malcolm X - who were ardent supporters of justice and assertiveness.  Gandhi, of course, placed a stronger emphasis on doing things for the right reasons with the right means.  I see this attack on Afghanistan as blind anger and not productive.
