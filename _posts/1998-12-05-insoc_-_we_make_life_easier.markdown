  I read more of <a href="http://www.insoc.org/">Insoc.org</a>.  The guy is really really cool.  His music is awesome.  He's good at the computer stuff he does.  His propaganda is hillarious.  I also agree with his opinions on drugs.  I wish more musicians were this cool.
  
  <p>So I was reading this astrological reading...<blockquote>
  VIRGO (Aug. 24-Sept. 23): If you want something enough you will eventually get it. Your heart tells you that is true even if your head says it is illogical. Of course, if the something you want is something you were destined to have, it could arrive any time - like 
  today, for instance.
  </blockquote>
  This tells me nothing new.  The first sentence is something that a lot of people believe, but their is no real way to prove.  The second sentence probably applies to everybody.  There are some things that just aren't feasable that we may want.  If I'm destined to have something, yes of course I could have it at any time.
  <p>I really love this journal thing.  It's an excuse to not talk to people individually.  Why bother?  Most people are bound to not give a care about one or two (at least) of the things I talk about.  Why risk having one of your ideas ignored?  So I have this journal system.  I can post any damn idea I have that I feel needs to be shared.  If someone's interested and they read it, they can talk to me about it more.  If they aren't interested they just skip over it and I don't feel like an idea of mine has been ignored or not understood.  
  <p>I think I know why I dislike my roommate.  He's inconsiderate.  I'm currently working on my final paper for speech and he's currently watching Street Fighter videos with a friend.  He could have asked.  It's blatantly obvious that I'm working on a paper.  I'm not going to make a situation awkward and ask him to not watch this.  It is his room too, I just wish he's be a bit considerate.
  
  <p>Ugh, I was a bit foolish to eat a Chicken Cordon Bleu for dinner.  Not only do I remove the ham inside it, but the cheese that's in it doesn't agree with me.  It's a pity that the insides of me are so much like my brother (lactose intollerant).  One day they'll synthetically make food that tastes good.
