title: No voltage for Dave
excerpt: "I am one of <a href=\"http://www.pioneerplanet.com/docs/storm601.htm\">89,000 powerless customers</a>.<p>Hopefully by Thursday (when my damn CS project is due) I can utilize my home for something more than sleeping taking a shower and reading.  I don't even know what to eat.  I'll eat Tom.  I'm at his house, I may as well... no wait... I need Tom... hmm... oh well.<p>So far being without electricity has taught me one thing.  Reading is fun.  Make that two things: The sun is nice and bright, and is a decent source of energy.  Nevermind, 3 things: More research and engineering needs to go into power distribution and efficiency.  Like we should be using solar power."
