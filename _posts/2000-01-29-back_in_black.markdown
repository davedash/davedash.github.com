title: Back in Black
excerpt: |-
  So I got this black turtleneck shirt for cheap at your store for everything.  I've been wearing black all day and looking like a ninja/poet.  That was pretty cool.  If you people are just checking to see that I have not flipped (too much) or have not gone into a downward spiral of depression - fear not.  All is well.  In fact... I am winning the fight against failure (it is vague and I intend to keep it that way).  
  <P>On a musical note, I found a special song from Orbital called "Belfast/Wasted (Vocal Mix)."  It's the first time I heard singing in an Orbital song.  Also, now that I hear it... Belfast alone is one of my favorite songs from the brothers.  It's very soothing.  It's something I'd like to wake up to in one of those Euro-cities.
  <P>Euro-cities... it's amazing to try to figure out what life might be in the future.  For me I want one of those jobs where I'm always moving.  Traveling from city to city.  I need a dynamic environment.  What I do from city to city is relatively irrelevant.  I'm not going to be a traveling salesmen... but I could be doing any number of things.  I want to do something where I can be in all black, like I am today.  Listening to Orbital or whatever floats my boat in the future as I do now.
