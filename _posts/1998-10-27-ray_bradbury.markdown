title: Ray Bradbury
excerpt: If anybody really really wants a signed copy of a Ray Bradbury book, I may be able to work something out.  His books go on sale Thursday at 3:00 PM (probably going to be actually marked up), and he will be there signing books at 4:00 PM.  I'm sure I could work something out.  I just need to know sometime on Thursday before 3:00 PM.
