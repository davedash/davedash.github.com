Sometimes I wonder what convinced me to buy a ReadyNAS and use rsnapshot to create incremental backups.

Oh yeah, I know, because when I, like an idiot, accidentally hit "Remove" in svnX and realize there's no undo... I've got options.

SVN revert, and then open up the file back in TextMate, find today's daily snapshot and drag it onto my editor window.  Verify everything and save and commit.

I like that my past-self is friends with my current-self.
