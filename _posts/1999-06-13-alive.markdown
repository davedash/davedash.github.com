excerpt: |-
  There's something about my staying in Champaign, IL that's made me 
  appreciate the simple fact that I'm alive.  The ability to take a nice
  stroll around the block.  To walk on a sunny day.  To go for a swim.  
  To have a moment to think.  It's made me appreciate life.  I'm going 
  to miss living at a place where I have a lot of friends around.  I
  think I'll do fine anyway.
  <P>I'm watching <I>the Saint</I>, again.  That's a movie worth watching.  
  The second time around is very cool, since I recognize the music.  It
  all sounds so wonderful.
