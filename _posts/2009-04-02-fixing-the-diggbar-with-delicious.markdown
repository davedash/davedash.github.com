title: Fixing the DiggBar with Delicious
wordpress_url: http://spindrop.us/?p=256

I've been tooling around with the [DiggBar](http://digg.com/http://spindrop.us/) and I've been quite pleased... but I was a bit annoyed that it was hard to bookmark things in Delicious via the digg bar.  I'd have to either close bar and then bookmark in delicious, or right click on the url in the DiggBar and then change the title.

I'm fundamentally a lazy programmer, so I wrote [some greasemonkey to save me some time](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/45716).  Hooray... diggBar+Delicious.
