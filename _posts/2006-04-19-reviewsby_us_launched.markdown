title: reviewsby.us launched
excerpt: |
  A week or two back I launched reviewsby.us.  I'm still missing some components that will make it a lot better and more useful, like an about page.
  
  So what is it all about?
  
  Katie and I frequented restaurants like <a href="http://reviewsby.us/restaurant/cheesecake-factory">The Cheesecake Factory</a> and we'd inevetably order a dish that we really liked or sometimes a dish we could have done without.  So I started logging them in my <a href="http://wiki.davedash.com/">wiki</a>.  Well, that worked for a while, but I thought letting other people in on the action would be even better.  So I created <a href="http://reviewsby.us/">reviewsby.us</a>.  People now have a site where they can share their dining experiences, and comment on their favorite dishes and dishes that they want to avoid.

I want to stick to that mission and include features that make future dining experiences that easy.  I hope you all enjoy it as well and can tell me how it can be improved.
