title: Networking
excerpt: Networking is really cool.  A friend of mine on this floor, Erin, is interested in researching education.  So I emailed the professor I worked for and asked him if he knew of anybody who was working on Educational Policy or something.  Well within an hour my friend recieved a response from a professor interested in meeting her... now if only I could get in on working for some AI thing at the Beckman.
