title: The uber-mind
excerpt: |-
  I've been learning a lot this week.  I keep putting information into my brain until there is too much for it to handle efficiently and then I sleep.  I repeat this process.  I plan to keep on learning for ever and will become the world's uber-mind.  I will mediate the world's problems and propel the world into the future.
  <P>I've decided I'm going to learn everything I ever wanted to know or at least die trying.   Like I really want to know about basic computer architecture, Hindi and probability this week.
  <P>People who consume batteries quite a bit... you should think about using NiMH rechargables.  They do not suffer from memory problems and they last a significantly longer time than older rechargeables.  Energizer sells them at Best Buy and on <A HREF="http://www.batteries.com/">batteries.com</A>.  To give you an idea of the cost, I bought Scott a charger that came with two batteries and a four pack for a total of $35.  So the initial investment is there, but really, it's $35.  If you have any devices that rapidly consume batteries (portable cd players, walkie talkies, flashlights, robots, etc) this will easily pay off.  The reason I mention the importance of NiMH is because I think people should be educated about what they purchase.  Battery companies do not want you buying NiMH (although they manufacture them due to the market) because it takes away from their disposable battery market.  NiMH may cost about 3 times as much than regular batteries, but they have about 1000 recharges.  This means battery consumption will continually decrease.  NiMH batteries will last maybe 70%-80% as long as regular alkaline (these are ballpark figures that I estimated from using CD players and walkie talkies).  So their performance isn't that bad.  I want there to be enough exposure of this technology that society moves on from its wasteful, pititful yet disposable batteries and into these wonderous solutions.
