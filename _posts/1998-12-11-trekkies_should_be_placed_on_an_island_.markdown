  The people who created Unix and C were awarded by the White House.  I think that's neat.  People should do things that result in their recieving of a reward.  Unix and C are integral operating system and programing language respectively.  Most of the Internet relies on Unix servers and everybody uses C to write programs.  I can't wait till all the letters become as important as the letter C.  Let us all give praise to the letter C.
  
  <p>Apparantly theatres in New Dehli and Mumbai (Bombay) were sacked by the ultra-nationalist Shiv Sena for showing a movie, <i>Fire</i>, about lesbians.  India is a Hindu state.  No matter how much religion is seperate from Government, it's very plagued with religion.  For this reason what some people view as not expressing Hindu ideals will be supressed.  So any of you who thought that Hinduism was this all accepting religion and that anybody can be a Hindu, I suggest you reevaluate your assumptions.  There are many Hindus that hold onto very prudent ideals.  They may be few, but they are willing to ruin

  Hinduism for everyone else by making it appear to be this very strict religion.  They are also appealing to many people in power.  The movie is being reviewed by a censorship board.  One day India, one day you will rise out of your depravity.  You'll no longer be the backwards country with nuclear weapons and a strong religious right that thrusts its wills over the nation.  On that day, the five or six lesbians that make up the lesbian population of India can come out of the closet.  Maybe I can have a crack team of lesbian soldiers (Fish Speakers) militarize India.  
  
  <p>I'd like to say that I do not approve of most of the things that go on in my country of ancestral origin.  Many Hindus have been celebrating the sixth anniversary of the razing of a historic mosque.  This razing has led to heated religious strife among Muslims and Hindus.    I find this religious intolerance extremely backward and digsusting.
  
  <p>My speech went horribly.  I am done with classes.  Finals are next week.  You can look at the <a href="calendar.php3" target=_self>Calendar</a>.  I have two papers I need getting done by this weekend.
  
  <p>I saw <i>Star Trek: Insurrection</i> and got just what I expected.  A movie that had neat looking ships and fights.  It was campy too.  I think I enjoyed it because I made so much fun of Star Trek and the trekkies.  I really hate Star Trekkies.  I mean they think all these things in Star Trek are so cool, like Data and his neat little misunderstanding of being human.  There were points where people laughed at the dumbest things, I mean come on.  Riker was really trying to get it on with Troi.  It is a good laugh though, and a lot of stuff blows up.
