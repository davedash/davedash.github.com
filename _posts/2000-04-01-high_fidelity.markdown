title: High Fidelity
excerpt: |-
  I just saw High Fidelity yesterday.  It features John Cussack (Better Off Dead, Grosse Point Blank).  It was awesomely funny.
  <p>My DiffEQ test went well.  I start to wonder at the usefulness of taking a DiffEQ course.  I know it too well.  It's like an old friend who betrayed you and you have been spending years to forget.  Then that friend pops back into your life and it expects you to forget all the past differences.  Well DiffEQ and I never really quarelled.  
  </p><p>
  I've got two new toys on my want list.  The first is a $180 Vtech full-duplex speaker phone (I hate speakerphones because of the single-duplexity that is so abundant).  The second is a newer walkie talkie (also $180).  Motorola hasn't released it yet, but hopefully I can get an employee discount.  The new walkies have speakerphone... heh... (which by the nature of two way radios is single duplex, alas).
