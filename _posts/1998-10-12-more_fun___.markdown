   7:10 PM: Alan came into my room and told Jack to stop playing video
            games and to do his work.  Jack asked,  "Why?  I don't want
            to be a nerd."
   7:11 PM: Alan asks about my waveform and explain that it's a pattern
            I can lock onto rather than video game noises.  Alan laughs.
            Jack stops game and leaves room.
   7:13 PM: Jack returns and does something at his desk.  May be a form
            of studying.
   7:16 PM: Jack makes phone calls.
   7:18 PM: Jack is speaking Chinese to someone.  Outside room.  Cannot
            capture easily.
   7:21 PM: Jack is off the phone.  Back to desk.
   7:30 PM: Jack dons the headphones and listens to groovey music.
            Possibly Chinese in origin, or maybe Aerosmith.
   8:02 PM: Jack goes out of the room.  Curious about something.  Asks
            if someone is having a party.
   8:14 PM: Jack hears TV.  Turns his TV on and watches what the other
            TV has on.  Then turns his TV off.
   8:16 PM: Jack was called "Twinkle Toes" by Eric.  Jack goes outside
            and talks to him for a bit and returns all in the same 
            minute.
   8:23 PM: TV on to same show again.  I guess he needs the TV on to
            function.  Funny.  He isn't even looking at it half the
            time.  I think Aaron Engelhart may have clued me in as to
            why TV is so addicting.
   8:30 PM: TV off.
   He left for a while...
   8:58 PM: Back to TV and Video Games.
   9:02 PM: I was going to mention he kept the volume quiet, but no...
            sure enough he just turned up the volume.
   9:10 PM: White noise with only an alpha wave sync... umm turning that
            on at a low volume made him change his volume... lower I
            think.
   9:49 PM: TV off.
   9:50 PM: Out the door.
  10:29 PM: I came back into my room after taking a Hot cocoa break.
            Someone smells smokey-smokey...
  10:31 PM: Back onto the playstation.  SF probably.

  One day he'll find these logs, and I will pay.  Oh will I pay.  Until then, I will enjoy this as much as possible.<p>I can't write poetry unless I'm in an angry mood.  Maybe because when I'm angry, I have nothing better to do, or I'm trying to pour out all my thoughts.<p>
  I decided I'm going to rev-up some of the links on my site, before it dies.
