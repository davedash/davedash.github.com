title: Lake Harriet
excerpt: "Today I went to two graduation parties.  One was <a href=\"mailto:dan@ftmax.com\">Dan Fisher's</a> the other was a friend of the family's.  Tonight we went (without Dan and Amy) to <a href=\"http://twincities.sidewalk.com/detail/18439\">Lake Harriet Bandshell</a> with Dan Lavenda, Katie R, Jesse B and Molly.  We rode in Dan's little SAAB.  It was nice.  We were only there for a small bit, because we got there late.  Katie bought me Ice Cream, it was good.<p>Funny: Police officers were walking around and I guess there was some type of threat.  People were told to move away from a certain area.  The announcer said there was a yellow blanket with a bag with unknown contents.  I guess some type of threat was called in.  There was police tape and everything.  But I guess some people claimed it was there bag.  It was really funny.  I mean they didn't want us to clear too far, but gee if that were a bomb... hmm... if I planted a bomb.  I would never call in to any place and tell them.  I'd keep it a secret.  That way they won't look for the bomb.  I'm so much smarter than criminals..."
