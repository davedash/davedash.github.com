title: An update for all ages...
excerpt: |-
  I saw <i>Bullworth</i> the other day.  I liked it.  Despite it not depicting 
  blacks in the best light.  Then again, I should like these things, because 
  according to some people I am racist (along with most of my floor).  See it 
  if you have not yet.  You may or may not like it.  You may see it and then 
  bitch about what a bad movie it is, but I don't care.
  <p>
  I got the position as a NetTech (Rhymes with TeX).  I'll tell you more as I find 
  out about it.  It pays about a dollar more than my regular job.  I think I need to work really hard and get a raise:)
  <p>
  Speaking of money...  I used to have this idea that I needed to make a lot 
  of money.  Then I realized that is useless and it is what everyone 
  tries to do.  Everybody tries to make this enormous nest egg.  
  Well I think I'll make a safe nest egg, but rather than making it 
  grow and grow, 
  I will only try to make more money if I need it.  So like let's say if 
  I want to start a project, only then will I say okay I need so much money 
  now I'll try to get money for it somehow.  Maybe this is what people actually 
  do, but they always say that they want to make tons of money.  I see no 
  benefit in tons of money unless you know what to do with it.
  <p>
  A few nights ago Matt and Kristine kidnapped me from DCL so I wouldn't 
  get raped.
  <p>Last night I was pissed off and wanted to kill someone, can you guess who?
