title: Eye update...
excerpt: |-
  My eye was very swollen this morning and has acted as it did when I came out of surgery.  This is understandable.  My doctor just told me that I should have removed the entire rod, lest it get infected.  Unfortunately I could not get at the rod.  So I've just cleaned the area as much as possible and taken some acidophilus to combat any bacterial infections I might get.
  <P>(Note: Times are now displayed in CST).
