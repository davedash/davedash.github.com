title: My tragic flaw.
excerpt: |-
  I tend to write in the second person when I should be writing in the first person.  Here is an example:<blockquote><i>
  When living away from your friends and family on a college campus you feel somewhat withdrawn and start relying on email.
  </i></blockquote>Rather than:<blockquote><i>
  When living away from your friends and family on a college campus I feel somewhat withdrawn and start relying on email.
  </i></blockquote>Small difference but it should be noted.  I don't know why I do it either.  Oh well.<p>ANybody notice the new wave of skin-able programs?  It's very strange.  Suddenly all these programs we use will all use skins.  Of course the only real program I use with skins is WinAmp, but others will follow.  Then again, I usually use bigname products like Microsoft and Microsoft... Adobe too I guess.
