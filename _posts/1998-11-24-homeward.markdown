  Well one final journal entry before I leave here and go home.  Sunday I bought a new CD called <i>For The Masses</i>.  It's a bunch of remakes of Depeche Mode.  Since age three or so I've been listening to Depeche Mode and the Cure.  My brother was into those two bands and it just rubbed off on me.  Lo and behold their is the Cure doing a cover of <i>World in My Eyes</i>.  Meat Beat Manifesto which "Kwis" introduced me to sounds like an even more electronic version of Depeche Mode.  They did a remix of <i>Everything Counts</i> which is one of my favorite dM songs.  Rammstein is a scary band, they did this version of <i>Stripped</i>, another of my favorites... this sounded very very scary - a stalker version of the song.  A lot of it was very "alternative" sounding.  In the 80s Depeche Mode was alternative... alternative today is so different sounding.  I don't even want to get into this topic of genres.  Some of the songs I missed were <i>Blasphemous Rumors</i> and <i>A Question of Time</i>.  That's alright though, the originals suit me just fine.:)
  
  <p>I also bought a $65 keyboard drawer.  It has neat gel rests for my keyboard and mouse (which is on a sliding tray), it's easily removed so I can use it at home too.  I love this thing and is definitely worth getting.  "It feels like breast" as one floormate remarked about the gel rests.
  
  <p><b><tt>ANNOUNCEMENT:</tt></b> When I mention an MP3, I normally will upload it to "the MP3 Server."  Some of you wonder what this server is.  This server is not run by me, and is not mine to delegate access.  A good number of the visitors of this page know of the server and how to connect to it, this is why I frequently use it to upload my MP3s.  If you do not have access to this server and want one of the MP3s I mention, I can send it to you if you live in my hall, or I can at least point you in the direction where I found it (usually <a href="http://www.mircx.com/">MIRCX</a>).
  
  <p>I finished <i>Speaker of the Dead</i>.  My hall has not yet purchased <i>Xenocide</i> which means I am bound to magazines and writing on the flight home.  I should have just purchased this book at the bookstore today.  What I did get at the bookstore is a nice legal pad and pad holder and a nice shirt.  That cost about $40 total.  I think I'm going to have to buy less stuff and start saving money.
  
  <p>Yesterday while watching the X-files there was an add for Ally McBeal featuring Ally going at it with some other woman.  I watched it while packing up.  What a stupid show.  I think I know a Chinese version of Ally McBeal back in Minnesota.
  
  <p>Okay, so I am going home tomorrow.  Leaving UIUC at 10:25 AM to Detroit.  I'll be at Detroit at 12:55, leaving at 1:40 and then reaching my final destination at 2:32 PM.  My incomming flight to MSP is 1137.  I will be coming into gate 18 I believe.
