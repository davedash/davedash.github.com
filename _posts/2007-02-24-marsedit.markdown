I recently read about the acquisition of [MarsEdit][] by Red Sweater Software so I decided to check it out.  I'm quite glad I did it does make my workflow a lot easier.  What I had been doing up until today was this:

1. I'd come up with an idea.
2. Open up my writings project in [TextMate][]
3. Open a new file and start typing ideas, etc.
4. Find the right blog to post it on (e.g. [Spindrop][], [davedash.com][dd], [yumbo the reviewsBy.us blog][yumbo] or [Metroblogging][mb]).
5. Login to the blog.
6. Cut and paste titles, categories, tags, etc.

It was easy to drop my blogging habbit ;)

Now, I can do this:
1. Come up with my idea.
2. Select which blog I want to post it in.
3. Write my idea.
4. When it's ready to go live, just hit submit to blog.

The one slight problem I have is I use a tags feature of wordpress in addition to categories (not sure why I don't just use categories, but that's another story), currently there's no easy way to deal with WordPress plugins' custom fields that I know of.  So there's an optional 5th step of examining the post on the site and possibly adding tags.

Still, these 4 steps are easy and all done from one app.  It also features a preview of your post that you can customize per blog with a custom HTML template.  Which makes it easy to just drop your blog's style sheet and see if your post looks right.

Definitely looks like a keeepr!
