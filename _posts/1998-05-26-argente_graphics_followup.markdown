  It turns out Ryan noticed that you have to be incorporated to sell stock.  Hopefully udnerstands that you have to be a public company.<p>
  I've decided to assume that I will not get any response from the two friends to whom I mailed letters.  It would be nice to get a response, but I'm not counting on one.  This way it will pleasantly surprise me if they attempt to communicate with me.<p>I am still "looking over" the linked list code for my C++ project.  I guess it's easier than I thought.<p>Due to "things" I will not finish the web site until July 11th approximately.  Although, I really would like to finish.  I bet one night I'll finish all of it.
