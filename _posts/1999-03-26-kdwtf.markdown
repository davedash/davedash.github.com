  Hi.<br>
  I run Linux now.<br>
  I have no customized kernel.<br>
  Which means no sound.<br>
  I am sad.<br>
  If I get the sound working...<br>
  And the kernel configured propperly...<br>
  My status will change.<br>
  My network connection has been messy for the last week as well.  At UI, CS Majors have problems when the network becomes the notwork.<p>
  <p>This is also the first update since being back.  It's nice here in Urbana.  Very springy weather.  I wish that girl were here.
