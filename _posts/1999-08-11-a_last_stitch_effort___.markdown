title: A last stitch effort...
excerpt: This morning I went to the doctor and he said that the eye is looking good which is reassuring.  He also removed the other stitch - so I am looking closer and closer to healed.  Give it one more week and the bruises should be gone.  Which means nothing to most of you since I'm leaving in a week so people who have seen me stitched up will be in Minnesota and my friends from Illinois won't know what happened, except from first hand accounts by me.
