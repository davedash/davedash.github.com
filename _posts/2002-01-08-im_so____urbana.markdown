title: I'm so... urbana?
excerpt: So... hello.  I am the website.  No, just kidding... I'm Dave.  I drove back to Schaumburg on the first (6 hours).  So... yeah, I was terminated (on my will mostly) from Motorola this Friday.  Moved out of my apartment Friday to my house in Urbana (3 hrs) and actually had to go back up to Schaumburg to exchange my rental van for a rental car and check out of my apartment (6 hours).

So... hello.  I am the website.  No, just kidding... I'm Dave.  I drove back to Schaumburg on the first (6 hours).  So... yeah, I was terminated (on my will mostly) from Motorola this Friday.  Moved out of my apartment Friday to my house in Urbana (3 hrs) and actually had to go back up to Schaumburg to exchange my rental van for a rental car and check out of my apartment (6 hours).<!--more-->That's right... on top of being since since post-Florida - I can't find my health - which turned out to be the flu or something - I drove 12-15 hours in a matter of five days.  Oh - and I moved almost all my worldly posessions too.

Luckily Horace came with me when I returned my van.    As per the flu - it is come time for the end game... I'm winning.  I always win.  In fact, most people do.  Why does the flu even bother.  I'm just going to kick its ass.  Yeah, sure I feel like I had the crap kicked out of me for that last couple of days, but now I'm growing stronger and more powerful than ever.  Fear me, flu.

So unpacking has been slow... but I think I'll be picking up pace tomorrow.  It feels good to be back.

So I've been thinking.  Since they don't have urinals in women's rest rooms - they can use that extra space for more stalls... or a couch!
