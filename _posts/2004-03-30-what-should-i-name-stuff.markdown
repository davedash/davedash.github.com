I'm writing this piece of software that keeps track of appointments for doctors and such (basically lets their patients/clients log in and make an appointment).  Appointment Software is came up with Schedule247 which  liked, but then I thought maybe I could shorten it to sched247 and actually get a domain that matches it sched247.com.  Alternatively I could get still get it and call it schedule247 anyway... or I could even get schedule247.net and break away from the .com ness, without venturing into creepy things like .us, .in, .pk, .il or .mil ;)

So I'll put it up as a poll:

Comment on this too if you'd like.
