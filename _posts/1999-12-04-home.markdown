excerpt: "So here's the update on the hunt for a home.  My robot (Adam Nagao) and I have expanded our search to include homes.  Homes are less easy to find, but we're finding things here and there.  We have recruited my friend Michelle Lohmann as Roommate #3.  We may end up stopping at that number (originally we were hunting for about 4).  I think Sunday may be the house hunting day."
