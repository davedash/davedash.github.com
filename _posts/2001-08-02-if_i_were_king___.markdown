title: If I were king...
excerpt: |-
  I always thought if I became head of a large corporation, I'd do antics like <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/world/middle_east/newsid_1465000/1465114.stm">this</a>.  So, yeah, maybe I'll do things like that if I became a leader of a country too.  I get to go home tongiht.  Yay!
  <p>
  In other news... I think Israel is acting in an illogical fashion (not unlike this country, the United States of America).  Bombing "extremists" and anybody that happens to be near them is not a suitable approach for whatever  ends they desire.  This is only going to fuel the much justified Palestinian rage.  Then again what is so extreme about standing up against oppression?  Most religions mandate some type of standing up in the name of Justice.  Hinduism has the concept of <i>dharma</i> - duty.  It's often hard to tell what our duty is, but it is always the righteous path of justice.  In <i>al-qur'an</i> it is said that death is better than living under oppression.  So all of a sudden Israel's condemned the Palestinians for standing up for their right to survive - unoppressed.  Not terrorists, but people who just want to live.  It is a shame when good people are driven to nasty things such as suicide bombing.  It doesn't need to be that way, and Israel is the one doing the driiving.  Peace.
