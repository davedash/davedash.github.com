The nice thing about some restaurants is they pay extra special attention to presentation.  That way if the food isn't to your taste, maybe it is at least pleasing to your eyes.  We know that just a list of each dish and comments about said dish served at a restaurant isn't going to fly.  But if we spruced it up with member-submitted pictures... well... now our eyes have something to see other than text and rating stars.

Now, who wants a [sundae in a boat](http://reviewsby.us/restaurant/adeles-custard-stand/menu/brownie-sundae)!
