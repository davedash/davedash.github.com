title: Check it out now... the funk soul brother...
excerpt: |-
  I remember several years ago during my first year of Hindu Camp my friend whom I met at camp, Shaan, and I were talking about how cool it would be to be able to bring up a song about any given topic.  We were pretty damn close.  I still do that.
  <p>Speaking of songs, here are some songs that have been running in my head: <i>Touched</i> by VAST, <i>The Rockafeller Skank</i> by Fatboy Slim, <i>Wipeout</i> from Orbital?  Anybody know what Wipeout XL is?  Email/ICQ me.
  <p>Yesterday I bought a new chair.  It's real nice, pneumatic, comfortable (but not so much that you fall asleep).  So yeah, it looks like it's out of Star Trek, I think...
  <p>I had breakfast today... we have good Grapefruit.  It wasn't bitter.  I failed at eating breakfast with Caroline, but I did get to walk her down and make a request to have my beds bunked.  Yes, that's what we have to do at our school... blech.  Request to bunk or debunk your bed.  Grr!  Supposedly it's free right now.
  <p>I figured out that there are three things I wish I'd have learned to play.  One is the piano.  If I could play that, I could play a keyboard or at least have a decent clue about how.  I'd also have liked to learn how to play the drums.  I mean that'd just be fun.  Then I could play a drum machine.  The other instrument is the violin.  I think violins sound cool.
  <p>Anybody know why most switches go Off-High-Med-Low rather than Off-Low-Med-High?  I should ask Marc, the EE major.
