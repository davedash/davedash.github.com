  This has definitely been one of my busiest and exciting weekends.  Dan, Ryan and Jesse came down to Chicagoland for last Friday the Fourth of July weekend and we saw Chicago everyday.
  </p><p>
  Saturday we went to the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/SpecialEvents/Festivals/Taste/Taste.html">Taste of Chicago</a>.  We sampled a bit of food here and there.  Then we visited the museum campus which is home for the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium and the <a href="http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/">Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum</a>.  We decided to check out the museum and we loved it.  
  </p><p>
  Sunday we went back with less of a plan.  We decided to go to the Taste again and then see the <a href="http://www.fmnh.org/">Field Museum of Natural History</a> which is noted for the most complete bones of a single dinosaur, Sue.  We later met with Susan at the Navy Pier.  While waiting Ryan decided to feed the birds bread, which ended up being more amusing than you would expect.  Afterwards we went to eat at Gino's Pizzeria where we had an unfortunate misunderstanding with the waitress (we were clearly wronged, but it wasn't worth arguing).
  </p><p>
  Yesterday... we left late from Palatine to the Metra station and ended up reaching Chicago around 3:30.  Later due to me being temporarily disoriented (and not looking at the map enough) we found ourselves around Lincoln Park.  Dan enjoyed the 2 hour walk.  Eventually Susan called me and told us that we should take a bus to get to where she lives.  (Not that we couldn't walk there, it was a time issue ;) ).  We met Neil and Stephanie at Susans and went to a staked out fireworks area on the lake shore.  After some games of cards we eventually got to see an amazing display of fireworks (not nearly as good as New York's tonight, but probably a good contendor for 2nd place).  Afterwards we went to Navy Pier, ate, and then missed our train back home and crashed at Susan's (for which we are by the way extremely grateful).
  </p><p>
  We snuck out of the apartment this morning and headed straight to the <a href="http://virginmega.com/">Virgin Megastore</a> and then <a href="http://artic.edu/>the Art Institue of Chicago</a> (with a stop at the Corner Bakery).  I noticed that I know more about earth than I previously believed, and I find some of it interesting too.
  </p>
  <p>After a long fun-filled weekend we finally came back to Palatine and my friends went back to Minnesota.  Cellphones and <a href="http://motorola.com/talkabout/">Talkabout</a> two-way radios came in very handy at times and will be seen in greater quantities by me in the future I hope.  This was a great trip and I finally saw a lot of Chicago.  I recommend that people come by Chicago sometime (with or without me) and check it out.  The Taste itself, wasn't that great.  The food wasn't unique enough, like it is in Minnesota... too many "generic" types of food, I thought.
