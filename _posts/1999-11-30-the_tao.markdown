title: The Tao
excerpt: "Our floor went bowling tonight.  That was a lot of fun.  Four Center rocks:)\r\n\
  <P>\r\n\
  I've decided that I do not wish to be an RA anymore.  My reasons are lengthy, and you can ask me in person, and I'll tell you, but it just isn't the box I want around my life.\r\n\
  <P>\r\n\
  I've noticed something over the year that is finally beginning to set into me permanently.  It is good policy to not injure people's feelings.  I remember I used to tease people to the point of being mean.  Teasing's okay within a certain level, but after a while things start sinking in.  If you joke around with someone and tell him or her that they are an idiot, it's only so long until they start questioning themselves as to whether or not they are an idiot.  Being a jerk or just plain mean doesn't help.  It makes things worse.\r\n\
  <P>On the flip side, I guess, you just can't let things get to you.  When someone tells you in a destructive manner that you are faulty it is somewhat difficult to just let it slide.  Put forth the effort to deal with things propperly and it will pay off.  "
