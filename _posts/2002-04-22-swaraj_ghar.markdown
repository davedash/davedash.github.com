So... I've annexed Ahmed's bunker since he's out of town for the weekend... and it's dawned on me for the last week, that I should have been his neighbor rather than living in a house of nine people.  Don't get me wrong.  I like my house.  But I think I'd like the independence of living on my own, next door to Ahmed.  Then I'd remember to close his freezer door so his ice-lollies wouldn't all melt.Life would have been so much better... and peaceful... oh well... mental note, if I get a time-machine.
