excerpt: "Saturday we were misinformed that trick-or-treating was on that day.  Unlike the rest of the world, Illinois seems to have designated days for trick-or-treating that are not necessarily Halloween.  After some embarassment we came home and then went to IHOP where we waited forever for some mediocre food.\r\n\
  <P>In case you have this desperate need to spend give me a gift, you can get me a pair of the Motorola TalkAbout 280 SLKs or the Motorola TalkAbout Distance. <A HREF='http://www.uiuc.edu/~sdhughes/'>Scott</A> has a pair of the TalkAbout+ and they are awesome.  We've been playing with them all weekend, even at IHOP.\r\n\
  <P>After IHOP I went to a party at my friends' apartment.  I didn't enjoy it too much.  Initially nobody was dancing, and then when the dancing started it was too small of an area and not enough girls.  I decided to hang out at <A HREF='http://www.mattwright.com/'>Matt Wright</A>'s apartment, two doors down, for most of the night.  I spent most of the night talking with Kristine's friend, Dan.  At about 2:30/1:30 (1:30 if you set your clock back), problems with one person drinking too much occurred.  He was brought into Matt's apartment and I decided that between a dozen people trying to help while at the same time yelling at each other that I should leave.\r\n\
  <P>Sadly, what could have been a decent Halloween party wasn't.  Halloween Day itself didn't seem much like Halloween.  I could have gone trick or treating, but I was too busy.  I stopped by Matt's again that night for some really good dinner and then we watched the Simpsons.  All was good.\r\n\
  <P>I really don't mind people drinking.  I don't like it when they get drunk, especially to the point when others are at risk and the person's life is at risk.  Then I worry.   "
