Occasionally I'll read [Steve Pavlina's blog][sp].  If you're looking to improve some aspect of your life, it will serve as a good resource.  

He has a post called [30 days to success](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/04/30-days-to-success/) which applies the idea of the 30-day trial to the real world.  For example, instead of quitting smoking, try committing to only quitting for a month.  If you like the results *then* you can quit forever.  The idea is that you psychologically might be willing to accept a certain state of affairs if it's only temporary versus if it's a permanent life change.

I was intrigued when I read it and I had started a few blogs so I committed to writing a post each day on at least one of the blogs.  It worked well at first.  Great, I might add, but toward the end of the trial I started falling.  It eventually didn't work.

That's not a bad thing.  It was a lot easier to do that then to commit to writing a post daily for the rest of my life.  Now I only feel like those 30 days weren't a success... not my entire life ;)   I did learn a lot.

* Sometimes inspiration doesn't hit at 5am every morning.  
* Writing on a schedule is a chore and therefore not fun.
* Writing a post a day made quality suffer.

So I learned a lesson.  Of course, I did end up not writing that much after the trial either... so it's important to know when to stop.  I still like the idea of the 30 day trial, and plan on trying it again.
