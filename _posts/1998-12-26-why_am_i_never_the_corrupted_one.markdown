title: Why am I never the corrupted one?
excerpt: |-
  Quantum transportation is neat.  I think it will have a good impact on Quantum Computing.  I'll give you some links on Quantum computing later, I have a few somewhere.
  <p>Don't look at the TV form  more than a few seconds.  It will pull you in.  Turn it off.
  <p>What would happen if we killed the laugh track?  Television would have to be funny on its own.  Note that except in mockery, cartoons never use a laugh track.  They stand funny on their own.  Sitcoms rely on the laughtrack to goad you into laughing and then thinking that the show makes you laugh so it must be good and must be watched again.  It's a catalyst for sitcoms.  It's very deceptive and clever of the TV people.
  <p>I saw <i>Prince of Egypt</i>.  It was fairly interesting.  It connected the few Moses stories I knew together and took less time than actually reading Exodus.  The animation is of a high level as well.
  <p>I saw <a href=http://home.earthlink.net/~smohanty/>Su'</a> today.  Su' is back, and I am happy.  Unfortunately she leaves Sunday, but I will see her tomorrow at the wedding pre-reception (preception) that I am attending.
