I used to/still have a cavalier attitude toward flats.  I figured when/if I get one, I'll lockup and bus home, or walk.

Yesterday, in 80+ degree heat, I chose walk... I went a mile to the Dunn Bros coffee shop cooled down and went a mile to get home.

Despite better judgement I fixed my flat when I got home in my very warm garage.  With the right tools fixing a flat is easy, but the pouch I carry... is missing a lot... namely *a wrench* to undo the wheels and *a pump*.  

Here's a tip for flats:

Place the nipple for your tube in the middle of the "INFLATE TO x-y PSI" this can be a frame of reference to find out where your tire was penetrated.  Once I found the leak on the tube (conveniently on the opposite side of the tube from the nipple), I found on my tire some tiny orange glass or plastic that had sliced into my tire.

We'll see how well my patching is.  Time to buy me a wrench and a pump ;)
