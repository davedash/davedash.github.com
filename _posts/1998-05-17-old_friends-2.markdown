  X-files... neat<p>
  I ran the following commands and surprised myself:<pre>
  finger "jesse christensen"@umn.edu
  finger wieman@umn.edu
  finger biever@umn.edu
  </pre>
  Now you may wonder, who are these people?  Well these are old friends of mine from Bloomington.  I just did another one but am somewhat unsure:<pre>
  finger "d andreasen"@umn.edu
  </pre>
  But it's a pretty good chance that this is correct.<p>It makes you somewhat happy that everyone goes to the U of M, because you know how to find them.<p>
  Unfortunately they won't have activated email accounts, etc. until after they go to the U of M, which is this fall... oh well...
