title: Finished?
excerpt: |-
  So apparently I am finished for college.  That still seems strange.  I feel like I am on spring break or something.  I guess until I finally get some clients for my business (and my business partner finishes his classes) it'll sink in that this isn't quite break.  Other things will sink in as well...
  
  I really do feel like I'll be seeing everyone in a week or so.  Like maybe I'll catch a movie with Shafreen, Ahmed and Raana again.  Or spend some time hunting Shaf' down only to find her asleep during lunch time.  Maybe a bunch of us will go to Custard Cup to cool off after a hot day.

Luckily I'm so busy here.  I'll visit inshaAllah fer sure.  I miss people too much not to do so.

So this is the plan for week one.  Get some brochures ready and other materials to &quot;advertise&quot; myself.  Also to set up DSL and networking at Kelly and Raj's.  Start working on a website for the company.
