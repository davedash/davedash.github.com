  Matt's <a href="http://www.cgi-resources.com/">site</a> is really 
  cool.  I had a behind the scenes look at it.  It looks very nice.  
  So nice that it inspired me to work on my web site.
  <p>Thanks to my university and their development of
  <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA</a> Mosaic, web design is a 
  lot of graphic design.  So, I'm going to be spending several hours 
  working on various graphics that I'll need for my web site.  
  Unfortunately, I must acquaint myself with GIMP, an image editing 
  program that seems to have more power than photoshop, but none the 
  less will take time to get used to.  I'll recreated
  the dd logo I did in Photoshop.  
  <table align="right" border="0"><tr><td>
  <img src=http://ftmax.com/pics/dd.logo.gif border=0></td></tr><tr><td>
  <font size=-2>dd logo rendered in Photoshop</font></td></tr></table>
  <p>
  I have a few more URLs and bits of information to give, but I'm too tired.
  <br>
  Goodnight.
