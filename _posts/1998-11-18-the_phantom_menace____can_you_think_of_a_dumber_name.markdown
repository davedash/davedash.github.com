  <p>I will begin reading <i>Speaker for the Dead</i> (sequel to <i>Ender's Game</i>).  I don't know if I will like it as much, although Tim Cheng says it was a good book.  I'll start in CS 100... oh wait.  Wow, I read <i>Ender's Game</i> in three days.  Wow.  Sorry, I always remember what I was reading because I always have a book in CS 100.
