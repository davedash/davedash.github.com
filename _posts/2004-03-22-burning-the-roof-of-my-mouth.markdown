So Katie thought egg rolls would be a good breakfast food and warned me "they're hot!"  I don't think they were that great in the morning.  They tasted real good, and they were hot so they burned the roof of my mouth.  When will I learn?

I had a mountain dew because I was falling asleep (I drink caffeine rarely these days) and I'm bouncing off the walls practically.

<a href="http://beta.davedash.com/rsg/">RSG</a> is coming along, it does verbs.  Let me know if you've got any funny sentences and I'll see if I can teach the RSG to say it or something close ;)
