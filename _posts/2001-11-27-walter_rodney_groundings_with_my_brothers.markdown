A collection of essays from the African activist, Walter Rodney.  Walter Rodney was banned from Jamaica due to his empowering speeches and harsh critique of the &quot;White-headed&quot; Jamaican government.<!--more-->This book is from 1969, which marks the end of a decade of renowned black leaders like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr.  Walter Rodney examines what it truly means to be a Black man or Coloured man in a world dominated by Whites.

This book is a great introduction into Black Power - or rather Black Empowerment.  It is also a good introduction to African history, of which I knew nothing, and now I know a little, but it has openned a door to whole knew world of interest for me.
