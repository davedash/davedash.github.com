excerpt: |-
  Wednesday we went to Valleyfair again with our kids.  That was okay.  Molly and I rode the Wild Thing three times and got a picture.  It's "cute."  We also went on the Hydroblaster twice.  Thursday we didn't do too much.  One of our kids, Priya, got in trouble.  That was funny.  Friday was the open house, and I think that went pretty well.<p>
  I went to see <i>the Mask of Zorro</i> with Nick Skinner and Molly.  It was a neat movie.  Fun for all ages.  Today I am going to invade a small town.  I'll be more detailed later.
