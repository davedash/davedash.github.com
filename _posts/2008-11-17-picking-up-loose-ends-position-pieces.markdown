I'm picking up a pet project of mine that I was working on a few months back.  It's written in Django and is openID enabled... but I didn't used [django openID][d] and I have no clue why... I wrote my own code.

My best guess is I wrote my own code, just so I could understand it better, and that perhaps [django openID][d] wasn't mature enough or documented well enough.

Whatever the reason, in the future when I take the non obvious route... that I actually document the "why?"  This will save me the tedious task of determining if I need to swap out my code and replace it with something that's more maintained.

In any case, it's certainly refreshing to tool around with Django some more... it's a lot more pleasant than the PHP that I'm often subjected to...
