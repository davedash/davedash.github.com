title: Can this be home...
excerpt: |
  Most of this was composed yesterday on the way back to Urbana.
  <p>Kudos for <a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/">Maximum PC</a> for using "Let's Play Master and Servant" as a title for a letter in their commport section of this January's issue.
  <p><tt>4:18 PM ET:</tt> Remember the girl who lives in Allen that looks like a clown with pink hair and overdone makeup (the one whom I should one day ask "Why?!?")?  LKooks like she is on my flight to CMI... WHY?!?!  And WTH is with my plane.  It's almost an hour late.
  <p><tt>4:50 PM ET:</tt> Flight is being boarded.  If I was willing to wait 2 hours for the next flight I'd have gotten $600 (Note:  I'm still regretting this indecision).  That's a lot, but I don't know.  This flight was way overbooked, but the row in front of me is empty.  I could've done the $600, but it wouldn't have been kind to Eric.  Then again, it's $600.  I'm not even worth $600.  $600 is a ride home back and then some.  Perhaps in the spring I will take advatage of Northwest's silly service.
  <p><tt>4:31 PM CT</tt> Well no $600 [for me].  Remember the three seats in front  of me that were empty?  I took two of them.  I'm also fully able to operate the sixth rows emergency doors.  I also think I'm more useful than nobody opening the doors.
  <p>These SAABs are nice (especially if you have 2 seats).  Nice leather seats.  When you go up you feel like you are in a wimpy roller coaster.  You also feel like life insurance is a good thing.
