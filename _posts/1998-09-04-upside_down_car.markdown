title: Upside Down Car
excerpt: That last message was really screwed up, sorry.<p>Today outside of <a href="http://www.folletts-e2.com/">Follett's</a> (on Green and Wright, busy campus intersection) Stefan and I saw a car that was flipped over.  It was pretty neat.  If I had a camera I would have taken a picture and scanned it.  I decided instead of being a gawker, I'd read about it in the <a href="http://www.illinimedia.com/di/">Daily Illini</a>.  I'd link to an article next week, but I don't think the DI archives quite as well as the <a href="http://www.daily.umn.edu/">Minnesota Daily</a>.
