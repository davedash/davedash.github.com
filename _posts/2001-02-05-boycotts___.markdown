title: Boycotts...
excerpt: I think the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/world/issues/mideastpeace/A26024-2001Feb4.html"> Boycott of American companies</a> by Arabs is really cool.  The article reports up to a 20% cut in sales (I imagine this is restricted to Arab countries).  The Boycott is due to the US Government supporting Israel financially.  My motives for thinking this is cool is I really dislike mass corporate influence.  I think people should boycott places like McDonalds because they are inferior to alternatives.  Unfortunately alternatives are becomming far fewer.  Alternatives being "hole in the wall" and family owned (excluding giant chains owned by families) restaurants.  Of course, if you like the crap that McDonalds serves you, then there is no hope for you.
