  Laureen was <A HREF='http://www.csmonitor.com/durable/1999/09/21/fp15s1-csm.shtml'>mentioned</A> in the <A HREF='http://www.csmonitor.com/'>CSM</A> tomorrow.  Go Laureen.  It's actually very interesting when it comes to what different post-undergrad schools look for from undergraduates.
  <P>I went to the <A HREF='http://expo.cen.uiuc.edu/'>Job Expo thing</A> at the Union today.  The methods with which Math/Science/Engineering students have to go through to get jobs are most interesting.  Well, it's time to make like a ninja and defenestrate?
