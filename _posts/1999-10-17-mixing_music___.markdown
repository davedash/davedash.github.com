title: Mixing music...
excerpt: "I'm wondering where I can get started mixing music.  I'm at the point where I can generally take parts of songs and figure out what they sound like and what they'd mix well with.  Now I just need to find some budget equipment (Power Mac and maybe a keyboard).  Then just work on getting tracks from artists and mixing them.  I suppose I could also DJ stuff.  DJing (well) isn't too hard.  I just need equipment and some practice.  If you are wondering what's behind all this, listend to \"Prodigy Presents: <I>The Dirtchamber Sessions: Volume 1</I>.\"  It's an interesting piece of work that mixes various things from different genres."
