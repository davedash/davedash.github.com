title: Crouching Tiger, Pay it Forward
excerpt: |-
  I enjoyed <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>.  A lot of the movement was a bit fast for me, but I thought it was a very good movie.  No complaints... except they chose not to speak English.  One day the Chinese will drop their moon language and converse with us in English.
  <p>
  Last night I saw <i>Pay it Forward</i> which I also thought was a good movie.  It had a good concept.  Let's say someone does you a great favor that helps you do something you could not do on your own.  For example, somebody saves your life.  Instead of paying the person back, that person tells you to pay it forward.  In otherwords you do a similarly good deed onto (in the movie's case) three other people.  Not an entirely foreign concept.  So that's going to be my thing.  If some stranger does something altruistic that helps me do something I couldn't do, I will pay it forward.</p>
  <p>Somebody like-likes me... but I can't figure out who, or if it's a joke.</p>
