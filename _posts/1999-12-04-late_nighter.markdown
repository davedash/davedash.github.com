excerpt: |-
  Yesterday was the Allen Late Nighter... it was moderately fun.  Their was pizza and pokey sticks, which I was greatful for.
  <P>
  The earth is burning... but it makes for a pleasant December.  As summer rolls around your memory will be refreshed.  The earth will scorch itself and we will have to deal with it.  God forbid we get the industries who plunged us into this mess to stop.  How else will we get mass-produced trinkets?
