  The song from Simple Minds, <i>Don't you (forget about me)</i>, do not help me from dropping the whole search-for-old-friends.<p>
  Anyway, I think it's neat.  There have been fewer problems with my entries (either that or Yishan hasn't been visiting this page).  It's neat, when I hit submit, a page opens up and I can look at errors if any.<p>
  I had something to complain about, but I'm tired.<p>
  Oh, June 5th, I am going to see Truman with <a href="mailto:delmonte@ftmax.com">Molly</a> and possibly <a href="mailto:adame@ftmax.com">Adam</a>(probably at Willow Creek around 4).  If others are interested, just ICQ or <a href="mailto:dave@ftmax.com">email</a> me.  It looks like a good movie, if you don't know what it is, read about it, if you find it very interesting come with us, otherwise save your money until we tell you what we think of it.
