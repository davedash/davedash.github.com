excerpt: |-
  Since nobody has come to visit me, I've taken the libery of flying back to Minnesota for the weekend to celebrate my brother's birthday, my parent's anniversary and fathers day.  For kicks I'll arrange a road trip to Pal(p)atine.
  <p>
  Nothing too exciting yet... job is coming along slowly... having days where I tolerate it and days where I just want to leave and stop working.  It seems I find no comfort in systems administration.  I'd rather be playing with bluetooth...
