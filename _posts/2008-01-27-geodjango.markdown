I just discovered [GeoDjango](http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/GeoDjango).  The existence of this is awesome.

The GIS layer of [reviewsby.us][rbu] is incredibly complicated, and if I do another project of that magnitude, it'll be nice to know that a framework exists to tackle problems.  It looks functional, but not quite documentation complete for usage, but if I endeavor to learn more about GIS, I'm going to dive-in.
