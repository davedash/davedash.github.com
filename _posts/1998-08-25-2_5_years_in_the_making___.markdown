  Molly should be returning to the camp today and reading my letter.  She probably is having more fun than I, since she is not sick (and doesn't have classes tomorrow).  Right now I have a sore throat, which seems to be going away.  Unfortunately iced tea has been sold out.  My neighbor, Brian (pre med), told me to not take orange juice as it will make my throat worse, and suggested iced tea as a friendly substitute.
  <p>
  I skipped out on Quad Day today, and will review some of the stuff that Heather picked up.  I'll also talk to some of the Indian people I know and ask them what they are going to join if anything.
  <p>I went to First Year Impact.  It seems like a good leadership program.  My room is a god-awful mess.  I just have too much everywhere.  I have begun posting my Geometry Center posters everywhere.  It looks neat.
  <p>The cooling problem in my room is being improved with a box fan that I purchased.  My roommate, Jack, will be getting another fan this Friday when he goes to the mall.  I am thinking about getting a new phone.
