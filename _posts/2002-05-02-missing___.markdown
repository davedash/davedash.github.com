title: Missing...
excerpt: So the underclasspersons of DSC/SFP (mostly Hawaa, Laruren, Shafaq and Rumana) made lunch and cakes and whatnot yesterday for us graduates.  A truly kind gesture... I'm going to miss being here in the heart of their battles.  I only hope that I can find cadre equally as cool in my future journeys.  Otherwise I'll have to kidnap quite a few people.
