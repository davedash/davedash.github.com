title: Self-imposed moratorium
excerpt: So Aaron and I sort of have these self-imposed moratoriums on our activism.  We worked hours every day, and just looked forward to this... vacation of sorts.  I might crack soon.  In the meantime, I'm trying to better myself intellectually.  Katie B keeps me posted about what's going on and I am really compelled to do something.  I better just work on writing stuff for now.  I really want to get better.
