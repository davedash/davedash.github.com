 and I went to <a href="http://www.playitagainsports.com/">Play it Again Sports</a> and picked up some Rollerblades (tm).  They look real slick, the thingy that holds the wheels is metal... or metal-like.  It's used but it was only $50 (some good ones were $20-30... wrong sizes though).  So hopefully in the next 15 days (before we can't return it anymore) we'll get to try em out.   definitely check em out if you're in the market for new skates.

So, I'm in the market for a mirror casing for a passenger side mirror for a 95 Geo Prizm.  I checked on ebay and I could get an entire mirror for a 98 Prizm for $30, but I was wondering if people had any experience with getting parts anywhere.  I'll prolly call Checkers and Napa as well as Villiage Chev to see whether it's worth going online or not.

Also, I have no idea how to permanently attach something like that, so if anybody does, I'm all ears.  It's not the kind of mirror that moves back and forth when you bump it, it's just a fixed case that houses the motor for the mirror.
