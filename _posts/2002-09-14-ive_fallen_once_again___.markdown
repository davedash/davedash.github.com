title: I've fallen once again...
excerpt: It was bound to happen.  The culmination of slippery roads, unchecked old worn out wheels and my sporatic clumsiness means I fell whilst rollerblading.  No biggie... but it just shows that I haven't been blading enough if a little fall is news :)  Man, I miss urbana.  Perhaps I'll move to a neighborhood conducive to rollerblading... insha'allah ;)
