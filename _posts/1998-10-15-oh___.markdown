title: Oh...
excerpt: Yes, I know, I have a million updates today, but I'm bored.  Not because I lack stuff to do, it's just that I don't want to work on my big projects and I've been doing little things all day.  Anyway, I went to <a href="http://pages.nyu.edu/~lso202/">Laureen Ojalvo's site</a>.  It's been a while.  Out of my friend's sites I have seen I think that is probably the prettiest.  Ben Schack's page is neat <a href="http://umn.edu/~scha0354/">because it has</a> JavaScript that he took the time to write, but it's ugly.  Heh, my hyperlink to his page slipped:)<p>I wonder who else will start a page this year... it's pretty neat.  <a href="http://members.aol.com/shogun17/index.html">Stefan</a> was telling me that he's going to work on a page sometime.  Not that he'll have anything to put on it, but because it will be something he can pour his creativity into.  I think that's why people should make web pages.  Because they can be creative.  Of course... sometimes people's creativity looks like crap, and then I start to think that unless a page offers content it shouldn't exist.  Of course that's hypocritical because I have no real value on this web page.  It's basically, read about my life 'n' stuff.<p>I've decided to get a Logitech Marble Trackman.  I've decided I hate mice and they aren't very useful.  I may buy this when I get home, or something.  If anybody can find one for less than $42, tell me.  <a href=http://www.shopping.com/">Shopping.com</a> so far has offered the best prices.  They actually offer better prices than those listed in Pricewatch.com for various items, so I'd check them out.
