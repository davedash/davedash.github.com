anybody been to who-remembers-me.com ?  I got spam from it I think, but it may have been legit.  Sounds interesting.

Woke up super early, was going to leave for work at 6:30, but my car said "Car-X, now" and wouldn't start.  The starter had been finicky for the last week, but I just thought my floor mats were getting under the clutch, but yesterday it was really bad.  I called around and decided I'd take it to Car-X soon.  Soon means today apparently.  So they took it apart and it's as good as... well it's good.  The car sounds different, but that's okay.

Now when  takes it for a spin she'll not be off to a bad start (no, really no pun intended... I just couldn't phrase it any other way).
