title: I get paid good freaking money to get birthdays right.
excerpt: Well I'm stuck in a little bind.  I am not able to sign up for a certain class unless I have the right things from the U of M that say the C and C++ classes I took cover what I might be learning in CS 125.  Now I know what Kay feels like about getting into Madison.  Except, this is just one class... but it's one of those classes that you need to take or you don't go on in CS.  So now I am waiting for the CS Advisor at the U of M to get back to me.. hopefully they'll come up with something.
