title: Remote Desktop
excerpt: I was just remembering the good ol' days.  Back when I'd hang out in the Tech center at high school.  Sure it was also the worst year of school, but it had its high points.  Like when we installed Remote Desktop which enabled us to control other computers.  I remember we'd always make the web browser go to a porn site like www.sex.com or something when Ryan Hayle was near the machine.  I need to get something like that on some of the computers around me.
