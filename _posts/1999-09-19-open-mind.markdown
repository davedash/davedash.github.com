  I remember once in seventh grade I (among others) thought this person had severe problems because he did not believe in god.  I told my brother about this and he told me that this person's belief in god did not matter.  Then I didn't understand at all.  It's insane that someone would have no belief in god is what I thought.
  <P>A few years later I find myself as an agnostic.  Neither acknowledging or dismissing that there exists a god.  I also find myself more open-minded in other ways.  Accepting more and more people's rights to opinions, expressions and actions as they see fit.
  <P>I remember in eight and ninth grade where I wasn't fully comfortable with the idea of homosexuals.  Over the years that discomfort has waned, for the simple reason that it's not my place to questions others' personal interactions.  Since junior year in high-school I think I stopped being such a homophobe.
  <P>I like this principle of not questioning others' personal interactions.  It seems more fair or just.  What do I care if Mary-Sue (hypothetical) gets wasted every other night?  That's her choice.  If it was causing her external harm, then maybe I would step in.
  <P>I often wonder why it is that I originally did care about whether or not people did or did not do or think things as I did.  Is it the fact that my parents always had me believing one thing and not the other?  Not just my parents, but society as a whole.  Perhaps I questioned others as a child and while growing up because I was curious as to whether or not society was sending them the same message.
  <P>I also wonder what would happen if I met a previous less open-minded, easy-going Dave Dash.
  <P>On a similar note... I've noticed that I can respect opinions with which I disagree (or don't fully agree).  An example is Moby.  I read his ideas about animal rights and I think they are very interesting and I respect them.  Yet, I disagree.  I think a few years ago, I'd try to convince myself that anything I read, if it was a good argument and interesting and I liked the author, I'd buy into it.
  <P>This is getting long, I'm tired.  People can talk to me in person rather than read this.
