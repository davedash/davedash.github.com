  TITLE: I live.<P>
  Well all my stuff was finally moved 
  today, and I'm even online.  
  I was going to send an email to everyone, but I didn't know who 
  cared, so I figured 
  that if I just posted something that would cover most of the 
  bases.  
  Anyway, I will be in this apartment for half of my summer break.  
  I 
  plan on returning home on the 30th of June.  During my stay I will 
  be 
  continuing my work on the Illinois Chickscope project and various 
  other 
  "side" projects which I am not at liberty to discuss. ;)  If you 
  need 
  any other information just <a target=_self href="email.php3">email</a>
   me.<P>

  TITLE: Old email.<P>
  I 
  was digging through some of the old email sent to 
  mattw@worldwidemart.net (for Matt's Script Archives) and found one 
  from me, <a target=_self href="http://www.ftmax.com/msa-email.txt">
  enjoy</a>.

  TITLE: I want to praise you.
  <P>
  I want to <a href="19990513-thanks.txt">praise</a> 
  you like I should.  Thanks everybody for making this year 
  wonderful...
  <p>I've moved most of my stuff into the apartment at which I will be 
  staying.  I'll move the rest Saturday and start cleaning this place 
  tomorrow (Friday).
  <p>I landed on a stash of pennies.
