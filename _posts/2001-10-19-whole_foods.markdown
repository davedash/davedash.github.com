excerpt: So I have allergies to milk.  In fact, I would go as far to say that milk is racist, because most of the worlds population (in fact most non-white people) are allergic to milk.  So I went to <a href="http://www.wholefoods.com/">Whole Foods</a> to buy Rice Dream, because they sell it for a lot less.  This was my frist time at Whole Foods.  And wow, I was amazed.  Everybody should go.

So I have allergies to milk.  In fact, I would go as far to say that milk is racist, because most of the worlds population (in fact most non-white people) are allergic to milk.  So I went to <a href="http://www.wholefoods.com/">Whole Foods</a> to buy Rice Dream, because they sell it for a lot less.  This was my frist time at Whole Foods.  And wow, I was amazed.  Everybody should go.<!--more-->The place is an entire grocery store with health food and that neohippie-targetted crap.  All the vegetables are organic they have plenty of free-range meat, a lot of vegan stuff and it was all considerably less expensive then buying them at a regular store.  (Although slightly more expensive then buying the good ol' corporate backed non-health food counterparts).  It was a bit of a drive (20 mins out of my way compared to 2 mins), but it was well worth it.  Whole Foods Zindabad!
