Katie bought me a new Kindle 3G and a few people asked why I didn't get an iPad
instead.  Of course my answer is that I *have* an iPad.  It's just not a
comparable device.

The iPad is a general-purpose device that performs alright for web-browsing,
reading, checking email, etc.  The Kindle on the other hand is very optimized
for reading.

In fact, if Katie wasn't nursing, our iPad might just be an overpriced
[baby toy][bt].


### Electronic Ink

While in school and visiting India, I read a book called [*Being Digital*][b]
by Nicholas Negroponte of the MIT Media labs (which is ironically not available
for the Kindle).  Negroponte talked about a lot of fascinating new technologies
that they were working on -- the one that seemed the most futuristic was
"electronic ink."

[Electronic Ink][e] was ink on paper that could be moved around electronically.
This was fascinating, at the time I had been a teenager who would stare at a
CRT monitor for hours into the night.  The idea that there could be a future
where we'd be looking at paper-like displays seemed like a godsend.

Of course it was many years before anything came to market.

### My observations

* It's [reasonably priced](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmRKSds9OY).
* It feels like it's from an alternate future.  The fact that it's gray-scale
  and it can connect to the Internet makes it feel like a prop from a 60s
  sci-fi movie.
* It doesn't hurt my eyes.
* The buttons to turn the page are well placed.
* I like to see how far along I've come in a book and how far I've read at a
  given moment.  The progress bar tells me all of this.
* It's really convenient to switch from one book to the next based on my
  attention span.
* Bookmarking is easy, finding your bookmarks is awkward.
* It's light enough to hold with one hand.
* The dictionary is very convenient... I wish my web browser told me what each
  word meant if I hovered over it.
* Being able to resize text and reorient the screen is handy when walking.
* I can put Siddhartha to sleep by wearing a Moby wrap, and going for a walk
  and reading.
* The 3G model is only $50 more which is worth it for the off chance that you
  might want a book and not have Wifi or your computer handy.

All in all this is probably my favorite gadget.  I've only recently been using
it less since I have a brand new phone, but I think the Kindle will hold my
attention for longer.
