title: Bees
excerpt: "I'm afraid of bees and any bugs that can be mistaken as bees.  Lots of bugs crossed my path yesterday.  Urbana-Champaign decided to be warm this week.  MTV took over a small sector of campus today.  I managed to get a free demo CD from Intel and lemonaide form Old Navy who were assisting MTV.  The lemonaide made me have a strong affinity to Old Navy jeans.  This is why I love Molly, because she wears Old Navy jeans.... I think.<p>Okay, I'm up early, Jack is making all these wierd noises in his sleep.  Like drooly sucky noises.  This is disturbing.  It's the kind of thing that makes you want to kill him.  Why can't he sleep normal?!?  Thanks to the structure of my room, my open window doesn't make it cold unless the door is open as well (so the air can flow somewhere).  I left the door open when I brushed my teeth.  Jack is now covered in his blanket.  Okay, Jack tosses and turns in his bed.  This time he hit his leg against something, and he spoke, \"shit.\"  It's amusing.  "
