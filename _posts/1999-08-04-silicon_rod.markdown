title: Silicon Rod
excerpt: |-
  Well yesterday I went into surgery and came back with a new Silicon Rod in my eye region.
  <P>The surgery itself was very brief and I noticed it not.  However, healing from the stitches may take a while.  Getting used to an open eye may take some time too.  I should be good to go in a couple of weeks.
