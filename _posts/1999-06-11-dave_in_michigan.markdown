title: Dave in Michigan
excerpt: "I once thought no timezones would be a good thing.  However, the problem arises in not being able to assume similar schedules for people.  (E.g. 8 AM is not necessarily a good time to wake up).  Perhaps we should adopt a secondary time that would remain constant.  This could be a great clarifier.  Actually we have something like that called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  Unfortunately we don't use it.\r\n\
  <p>\r\n\
  Yesterday I had this discussion with people in the Inquiry group regarding charges for services etc.  The biggest irk was that Sprint is charging their E-rate to their long distance customers.  This cost was suppose to be absorbed by Sprint's profits.\r\n\
  <P>\r\n\
  I think that we should establish non-profit consortium's that regulate things like the Internet backbones (and other communal utilities).\r\n\
  <P>A logistics note:  I plan on postings whenever reasonable rather than maximum one per day... so you may need to scroll down once in a while.\r\n\
  <p> I made it to Michigan.  It's nice and hot here.  Grad party starts tomorrow.  People here are running mad.  Crazy I tell you.\r\n\
  <p>In two more weeks I get to see something else that start's with M.  Can you guess what that is? "
