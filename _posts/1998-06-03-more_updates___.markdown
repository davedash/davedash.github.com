title: More Updates...
excerpt: Odd as it may seem, <a href="http://webserv1.startribune.com/cgi-bin/stOnLine/article?thisSlug=STRM03">the Star</a> seems to be having the most updated information on my powerlessness.  I've been checking that paper and the <a href="http://www.pioneerpress.com/">The Press</a> everyday.  Looks like they are down to 50,000 or so homes with no power.  Edina, Richfield (I have a friend in my Japanese class from Richfield "denki ga arimasen..."), Bloomington areas have been hit the hardest.<p>It's interesting.
