A week ago, I would have said [this is still hell][l].  However, since
Wednesday, I've started to feel a lot more at ease.

I think a lot of what has changed is Katie and my attitudes.  Katie's been a
superstar at mothering and nursing Siddhartha.  While I work from home, she
does her best to do things without my help (although I don't mind getting her
some water or food while she's busy nursing).  After I finish work, I'm excited
to spend time with Siddhartha.  All the great feelings of being a dad that
people expect you to have right away... I probably just got all those feelings
in the last few days.

So here's progress in the last two weeks:

* Sibi is over 8 lbs.  He's clearly eating well, thanks to Katie.
* Nipple shield is no longer required for feeding.
* Sibi can pay more attention to us.  When he's not crying, sleeping or eating
  he's a lot more fun.
* Sibi can track objects and you with his eyes.
* Sibi soothes quickly with Katie, even if it means just putting him on the
  breast.
* Easier for me to deal when he fusses - I'm recognizing that its temporary.
* We've been able to take him out a little bit each day for walks or trips to
  the store.
* Lately he gives us a fair amount of sleep.
* Our low days have been less bad than previous low days..
* I got to go into the office for a bit.

We've no longer got Katie's mom to help us, and in some ways it's like the
training wheels have come off.  The adjustment was painful, like ripping a
bandaid off, but we're managing.  My mom has been in town and has
helped somewhat in terms of food and giving Sibi infant massages, but we've
been trying hard to do baby stuff on our own.  It's paying off.  We're a lot
more confident.
