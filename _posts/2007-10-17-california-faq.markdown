Katie and I are "officially" moving to California.  A lot of people have been asking questions about this, so I'll try to create a FAQ:

[delicious]: http://del.icio.us/

<dl>
<dt>Why are you moving?</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>Short answer:</dt> 
<dd>I got a job at Yahoo!/Delicious</dd>
<dt>Long answer:</dt>
<dd>
I work on the symfony project a framework that makes building quality web sites easier.  I will be contributing to this project in a way that is beneficial to Yahoo!.  Furthermore, Katie and I are looking for an adventure.  Moving out of our home in Minneapolis and into a new part of the country will be a big adjustment for us.
</dd>
</dl>
<dt>Where in California are you moving?</dt>
<dd>We are moving to the San Francisco Bay area.  We will find a place when we arrive.  We will likely be in Mountain View or if we can find some place affordable, the City of San Francisco.
</dd>

<dt>When are you moving?</dt>
<dd>We are moving in early November.  I start my job in mid-November.</dd>

<dt>That's really soon?</dt>
<dd>Yes!  I know!</dd>

<dt>What will you do with your house?</dt>
<dd>We own a duplex, we'll rent out the half we live in.  We're also finishing up our attic as I type.  Initially our good friends Marc and Sadie will live here.

</dd>

<dt>What about your cats?</dt>
<dd>We are not sure.  They will eventually join us in California, but we are not sure if they will come with us right away in November, or later.
</dd>

<dt>You're going to have a going away party?</dt>
<dd>Of course, just email me</dd>

<dt>What about your car/bikes?</dt>

<dd>
Car is being shipped to CA.  We bike a lot and intend to do so in California, so we'll be moving our bikes as well.
</dd>

<dt>Are you excited?</dt>
<dd>Yes.</dd>


<dt>What is Katie going to do?</dt>
<dd>
We will be getting an apartment that has a pool.  I can only imagine she will spend her days making daiquiris sitting by the pool.
</dd>
