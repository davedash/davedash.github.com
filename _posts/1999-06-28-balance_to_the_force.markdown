title: Balance to the Force
excerpt: |-
  There seems to be a misconception with Samuel L. Jackson's line: "We refer to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the force..."  A lot of people see the state of the universe as balanced in favor of light rather than dark, due to the Jedi's presence.  The truth is, there was plenty of darkness.  Force doesn't necessarily exist only in Jedi and Sith, but rather in everything.  It binds everybody.  There was a lot of darkness in the force.  The corrupted senate was the best example.  The fact that thousands of light Jedi existed to settle disputes, etc.  There was not peace in the galaxy.
  <p>For the record, I think Qui-Gon was wrong in a sense.  It is actually the son of Anakin Skywalker who does bring balance to the force by restoring the Jedi.  Of course Anakin did have a role in it by tossing out the Emperor.
