The "lazy" approach to usability is to just use a web site or application yourself and use [usability heuristics][h].  This is what I do, and it's why I have a huge to-do list of things to fix on the site.  Lately to build out the site content, I've been going to a lot of restaurants not listed on [the site][rbu].  This means I have a multi-step process after I eat:

1. Add a new restaurant.
2. Add a location.
3. Add a review of the restaurant.
4. Rate the restaurant
5. Add all the menu items I ate.
6. Tag the menu items.
7. Write a review of the menu items.
8. Rate the menu item.

For everyday users, I don't expect 1 or 2 and only a few of 3-8, but 1 is a requisite and 2 is nice for maps and just being able to get information quickly.  I did want to streamline this process, so I made a combined form that does 1,2 and 3 all in one place.  That's just six steps:


1. Add a new restaurant.
4. Rate the restaurant
5. Add all the menu items I ate.
6. Tag the menu items.
7. Write a review of the menu items.
8. Rate the menu item.


For most users it makes sense, since most restaurants just have one location - or if they are adding a restaurant they are only thinking of a specific location.

I also took the opportunity to do a check on restaurant names.  If you attempt to enter [Green Mill][g] twice, you'll be prompted that a restaurant with that name already exists.  It's not a very smart check, but it should serve it's purpose.
