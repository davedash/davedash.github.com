title: Simpsons Finale
excerpt: |-
  This is one of the worst episodes I have ever seen.  I mean, sure it was interesting as in suspenseful, but the show was in no way funny.  This definitely was not a good Season-Finale.  I could care less what any of the die-hard fans have to say.  I wasn't laughing.<p>
  The fact that the episode was so twisted was bad enough.  What the hell are they thinking airing a cartoon during primetime with <b>that</b> type of content?  I could understand if the show was funny, but it wasn't.<p>Oh well, off to my Japanese lecture.<p>Sayonara.
