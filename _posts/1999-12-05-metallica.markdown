title: Metallica
excerpt: It's been a while since I've listened to Metallica with enthusiasm.  However, I've stumbled upon this stash of Apocalyptica mp3s which are tremendous.  Although, what I feel is even better in many ways is the new 2-CD set from Metallica called S & M.  It's a variety of Metallica songs performed with by Metallica and the San Francisco Symphony.  I guess Metallica is on tour with several different symphonies.  That's a show I'd like to catch.
