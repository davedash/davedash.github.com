title: A monster may not enter the city limits.
excerpt: |
  Look at Urbana's <a href="http://www.dumblaws.com/">dumb laws</a>.
  
  <p><a href="http://www.lyrics.ch/">lyrics.ch</a> was closed recently.  The servers were seized by the Switzerland police.  :(
  
  <p>It's spring in Urbana.  It's nice and warm especially in the dorms.  It's really foggy outside.  Like you can barely see Foelinger from the Union.  Very cool.
  
  <p>"This might be the only time in your life where you get to see a bowling ball come at you that's not going to actually hit you." -phys prof.
  <p>I need to stop hitting ctrl-x-s to save my word documents and I've got to stop highlighting things to be copied.  Damn you Linux.
  <p>People wanted me to stop doing this page, because I'm supposedly better in real life... but not all my fans get to see me in real life.
