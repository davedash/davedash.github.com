title: Target is sweet.
excerpt: |
  There were a few problems with <i>the Matrix</i>.  The first is if the agents knew that 
  Neo was the one, why didn't they kill him?  I mean, why didn't they disconnect him 
  from the Matrix and then kill his body?  There is also the 
  problem with the self image.  Isn't it odd how Neo looks 
  just like he did in the Matrix?  Or how Morpheus looked like himself 
  in the Matrix?  Trinity is no different.  Also note the whole love 
  "thing" that was thrown in was total crap.  The subway seen had everyone saying 
  "Pick up the damn phone."  The resurrection was silly too.  
  <p>Don't get me wrong, it's still a good movie.  It teaches us an important lesson: 
  Image is something.  When they entered the matrix, they chose to look decent 
  they chose to wear sunglasses.  Those are things that make us look cool.  Looking cool is very important.  
  Something that is done well is better appreciated if it has points for style.  
  When Neo fights, he fights so it looks cool.  Very important.
  <p>
  I applied to be a NetTech at Allen Hall and surrounding residence halls.  I find out
   by the end of this week whether I become one or not.  Should be interesting.
  <p>
  On my concept of being portable, there is the issue of bonds to friends.  
  Sometimes we create the wrong types of bonds with friends.  Dependency bonds.  
  This is where we are so accustomed to their companionship that we depend 
  on their being around in order to function.  Very silly, but sometimes 
  detrimental.  Like what happens if the friend leaves somewhere, dies, or whatnot?
  Of course, people will still make these friendships.  It's something Molly and 
  I have developed for several years.  I develop it with a lot of people that 
  I to whom I grow "attached."  So it's something that should be forged sparingly.
  <p>Anyway, I'm tired of that topic for tonight.  Next topic is majors.  
  I have a good friend in my Math and Speech Com class and we tend to 
  discuss stupid people.  In our math class there are people who are possibly 
  Math/CS majors who just don't belong in math.  They don't enjoy doing the math 
  or learning about it.  At least in class that's the impression you get.  
  Additionally they do poorly on tests.  It's a sad thing.  You sometimes wonder why people just 
  settle for majors.
  <p>The other thing I hate is people who are in CS or even in the College of 
  Engineering just because they want a good job.  Getting a good job does not 
  mean anything if you don't like what you major in.  Engineering may be the best thing on campus 
  but it certainly is not worth doing if you aren't into engineering.  I guess a lot of 
  people do CS because it pays well or because they are good at using a computer 
  (whatever that means).  Those people should go to hell.  When they graduate from 
  U of I, they will have jobs and they will be the people who slow down society.  
  They have no true love for Computer Science, but rather a love for money.
   They will do as little as possibel to be in this major.  Whereas the real CS majors 
  work day and night coding and learning things on their own to become 
  very good at what they love, computing.
  <p>Enough ranting for one day.  Target would be sweet if you lived there.
