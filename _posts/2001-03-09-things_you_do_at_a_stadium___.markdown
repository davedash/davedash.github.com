title: Things you do at a stadium...
excerpt: Apparently there's <a href="http://www.dailyillini.com/mar01/mar09/news/stories/news03.shtml">no hope for beer</a> at Memorial Stadium (UIUCs football stadium) where the Chicago Bears might possibly play.  I say, let them have beer.  Not only beer, but I think we should allow marijuana.  Movies such as <i>Half Baked</i> seem to suggest that pot can act as an enhancer.  What could be better than watching a football game ... on weed?  No, really, I'd like to know.  Drop me a line.
