title: Even Burbach would be interested...
excerpt: Well my "family" celebrated Christmas this year.  My sister-in-law got me an autographed picture of Darth Maul (Ray Parks) and for my brother a poster of the Empire Strikes Back signed by all that were pictured on the poster.  Very cool stuff that would, I am sure, peak the interest of even Mark "Darth" Burbach.  For many of you that last part of the last sentence meant nothing.  This is because you have no knowledge of he that is Mark.
