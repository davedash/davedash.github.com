This first year of parenting started roughly and going into year two still has
its challenges but the ride has become enjoyable.

He's heavier, taller, easier to deal with, can take food from multiple sources,
mobile.  Overall, he's a lot of fun.  I enjoy my time with him whenever I can, 
and we even get to do "guy stuff" like grocery shopping
and running errands.

He brings us and others a lot of joy and I'm sure he will continue to do so.
