title: Happy Birthday Julie-Jew!
excerpt: |-
  It's Julie's Birthday today!  Yet another one of my (pre-)houseling celebrates her birthday.  Today I ate at Wok on the Wildside with her, Rachel and Julie (D).  More at 11.
  <p>On an unrelated note, yesterday I discovered Chinese food.  It's a restaurant called House of Chinese and Thai food.  It was rather good.  I shall attempt to frequent it more often and in greater numbers.</p>
  <p>And on another unrelated note, Brendon (my roommate) has a computer to call his own.</p>
