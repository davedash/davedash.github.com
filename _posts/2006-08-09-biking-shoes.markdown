I think I now have more shoes than [my wife][katie].  I just bought some [Shimano's biking shoes][s], bringing my total pairs of shoes up to 7:


1.	**Nunn Bush Dress Shoes**: These are the shoes my brother suggested I get as dress shoes.  They are dressy, but they are also comfortable for walking.  I've had them forever, and wear them the least.
1.	**Black shoes with some red**: These were some laceless shoes that I used to wear regularly.  Now they are dirty and I use them for working around the house.
1.	**Semi-casual black shoes with zippers**: These shoes are/were my daily work shoes.  They aren't dress shoes, but they are black so they work for going to the office.
1.	**AVIA tennis/running shoes**: These are an inexpensive pair of shoes I bought last year, when I wanted something sportier than my zipper shoes.  They've been real nice for biking (using toe-clips), and I liked wearing them around the office.
1.	**Brown sandals from India**: These are the sandals I wore at my [engagement ceremony][e] and [wedding][w] and now they are my lounging shoes.
1.	**Even dressier shoes**: These were another cheap pair from India (actually the sandals were somewhat expensive).  I got them because they were cheap.  I plan on leaving these at my office.
1.	**[My Shimano SH-MT20 shoes][s]**: I took the plunge and bought some [Shimano shoes][s] and [clip-less pedals][c].

No, I'm not a shoe-junkie.  I really just need the pair of shoes that I can use for working around the house, the biking shoes, and the dress shoes.  But now I have a whole bucket of choices for a while.  I might store some of them for a while.
