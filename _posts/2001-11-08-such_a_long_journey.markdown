A part spy-movie part drama that takes place in Bombay in 1971.  1971 is the year that India assisted the Bengali resistance in what was then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in rising up against the brutal occupational government of West Pakistan (now Pakistan).<!--more-->The movie was just on the onset of the war between India and Pakistan over Bengal.  It highlighted the political corruption that went on at various levels of the government.  It shows the cruelty of humans in power and their ambivalance to the weak.  It also shows the compassion and enlightenment of people.  It also had a nice seen of unity and resistance.  People taking it to the streets.

Good film.  Like I said... I'm not good at reviewing films.  So you'll have to deal.
