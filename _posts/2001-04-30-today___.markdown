title: Today...
excerpt: |-
  What a day... nothing too big... read the DI... and there was <a href="http://www.dailyillini.com/apr01/apr30/opinions/stories/letter02.shtml">this</a>.  So that was on my mind while I sped through my Social Aspects of Information test.  I got a lot of support though from the community who had read my article and the response.  Mike Frazin is a racist, he has no regard for the Arab peoples.  My second test took 10 minutes.  Insha'allah that I did well... usually it's a bad thing when I finish fast.
  <p>I ran into Zainab twice today and sat down and we talked.  Hadn't seen her in about a month.  Marc, my Judaic brother, called and that was good too.  In fact, talking to him, it seemed that we saw eye to eye on Zionism and its relationship with Judaism.  To quote a good idea: "All Jews should have access to the holy sites, but I have a problem with us owning all of Israel."  Masha'allah.  Here's someone who understands the situation.  Although his view seems even more radical than mine (see the points on <a href="http://www.nimn.org/">Not In My Name</a>, that's what I agree with).
  </p><p>
  I'm glad that I can find such great friends like Zainab, Marc, and even people who are relatively strangers to me, who not only understand my views, but share them to an extent.  I, by no means, am silencing out other views.  It's just nice to know that I'm not alone.
  </p><p><b>UPDATE: </b>Here is <a href="http://www.dailyillini.com/may01/may01/opinions/stories/letter02.shtml">today's letter</a> from UC Unity and Struggle's Aaron
