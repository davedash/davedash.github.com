  Well I've decided that I need to get back into doing web work again...  Right now I am in the middle of this long, tedious project that I may have mentioned earlier.  The Hindu Mandir Email Database.  Here is what needs to be done:<ul>
  <li>Create a script to parse the form and insert it into the database.
  <li>Create a form that lets you edit your entry.
  <ul><li>Write a new database that keeps track of users online, their IP addresses, the last time they were on
  <li>the form disallows people with an incorrect username, pw or who haven't done anything from their IP in the last half hour.  This is the same method I used for my journal.</ul>
  <li>Create a parser script to parse the edits.  I particularly hate doing this part.  It's somethign I need to do, but I never like doing it.  It's so boring.  I'll explain below...
  <li>Create a script that sorts people based on their last name.
  <li>Create a script that finds entries that are searched for.
  <li>Create a form that allows people to email others.
  <li>Create a bulliten board.
  </ul>
  That's a lot of work.  The outcome is going to be very neat though.  The reason I dislike this is long forms take a very long time to create.  After creating the form it takes a while to write something that parses it and shoves it into a database.  Then you have to do pretty much make a brand new form that lets you update whatever data is in the database.  It's a lot of time taking stuff that you do not get to see "evolve" until you finish.<p>When I design a web page, I make several sketches and then whip out the ol' drawing program and make the images and lay them out on the web page where I think they should go.  It's very easy and you can see this pretty little thing you just made.  This is why I am yearning to work on a real web site.  I'll probably ask Med-Rx if I can update their site.  It's been a while since I last did anything.  May 1997... wow, I usually say stuff needs updating (at least minor) at least once a year.

Well I've decided that I need to get back into doing web work again...  Right now I am in the middle of this long, tedious project that I may have mentioned earlier.  The Hindu Mandir Email Database.  Here is what needs to be done:

* Create a script to parse the form and insert it into the database.
* Create a form that lets you edit your entry.
* Write a new database that keeps track of users online, their IP addresses, the last time they were on
* the form disallows people with an incorrect username, pw or who haven't done anything from their IP in the last half hour.  This is the same method I used for my journal.
* Create a parser script to parse the edits.  I particularly hate doing this part.  It's somethign I need to do, but I never like doing it.  It's so boring.  I'll explain below...
* Create a script that sorts people based on their last name.
