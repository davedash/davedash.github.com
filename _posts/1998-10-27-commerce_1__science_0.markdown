title: Commerce 1, Science 0
excerpt: |-
  Take <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15806.html">this</a> Sagan! (sarcasm).  What horrible people will we become.  Nicholas Negroponte in <i>Being Digital</i> states something along the lines that we must not use "ether" as much as we do.  It must not be the main transmitter of bits.  We should come up with local systems that transmit mobile data to cable outposts which retransmit via wired to anything else (unless it's a mobile device, then it uses a local transmitter).  We have the know how.  Unfortunately it's not cheap to impliment.  That's why I want an army of men and women ages 19-35 to join my industrial sabotage group.  We will disable all inefficient corporate projects and integrate newere better designs that are designed with longevity and efficiency in mind, not some made up fairytale thing which we call money.<p>
  Speaking of science... look what the Danish have <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/articles/98/10/27/1524213.shtml">done</a>.  I could wait for an upgrade:)  Imagine the impact.  Technology like that, once it can be easily replicated will enable people to have nearly unlimited storage and memory.  This enables us to do so much.  Unfortunately science takes its time when it snuggles its way into technology.  I want to see <a href="http://www.micron.com/">Micron</a> eating this technology up:)<p>
  There's a new version of <a href="http://www.litestep.net/">litestep</a> (b24).  If you want your computer to look pretty, get this.  It's real easy to install and should work pretty fine.  I don't use it because I like my IE4 shell as it is.<p>
  Oh yeah, <a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,27965,00.html?st.ne.fd.mdh">NT 5.0 to be named Windows 2000</a>.  It seems logical as the Win95-98 continuation is being absorbed by the NT 4.0 progression.  I guess I'll be using the same OS as you (probably) will be.  Of course, that depends on the state of Linux next year.  It seems to be gaining a lot of popularity this year.  It's become easier to use.  And then there is <a href="http://www.corel.com/">Corel!</a>  Most of the stuff I do right now in excel, etc can be replicated using web-based interfaces, etc.  So I shouldn't care too much.  I'm thinking of buying a new CD-ROM for my old computer and slapping on Red Hat.  Maybe next year if I get a laptop it will be a Linux and NT machine... of course.<p>
  Sorry I've been away from humanity too long.  I have too much computer stuff on my mind.  The RIAA ban on Rio has been <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/98/10/26/213204.shtml">lifted</a>.  Rio is the handheld MP3 player.<p>
  Ooh, non-computer: <a href="http://www.fredlet.com/demotivation/agony.html">This</a> is for all you people who are sick of those motivational posters.
  <p>And, Molly and I by the end of the year hopefully will be both on the NetCam Network thanks to <a href="http://www.zdtv.com/">ZDTV</a> who deemed both Molly and I as winners of NetCam devices.  I decided to go the ultralegal route and have my mom sign it for me (since I'm under 21).  And then I'll send it in later this week hopefully.<p>Am I being too mean to Jack?
