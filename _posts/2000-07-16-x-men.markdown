  If you are a fan of the comics or the TV show I urge you to see it.  I just saw it and ... don't read the rest of the post until you see it.
  <p>I thought the movie was excellent.  It lacked a few things here and there, but the story was done really well.  Lived up to Stan Lee's nature.
  </p><p>
  In addition to good story was definitely awesome special effects.  So even if you have gripes about the movie (which I ignored) the effects were awesome.  I eagerly await a sequel.
