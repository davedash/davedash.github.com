title: Graduation
excerpt: Well after waiting hours for the long Graduation commencement ceremonies to end the Senior Party fianlly began.<p>We got on a bus, and went to the Medina Entertainment Center.  The food was mediocre, but they made up for that with good snacks.  The music was a little loud at times too.  There was a lot of things to do there, Bowling, caricatures, photo-buttons, winning huge prizes (which I could have gotten had Molly and I pooled our money together and gone into the prize room.  But, we found out too late.  (Some kid walked off with a Halogen Lamp!!!).  We had lots of fun.  Went to the hypnotist show (which I slept through).  I guess it was really good.  Then they had a drawing for a plane ticket, a couple TVs and some other items.  Nobody I know won anything.
