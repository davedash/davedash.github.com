title: Committed to Life (Assata Shakur)
excerpt: "I'll be honest with you\r\n\
  I hate war in all it's forms -\r\n\
  Physical, psychological, spiritual.... emotional... environmental\r\n\
  I hate war...\r\n\
  And I hate having to struggle - I honestly do\r\n\
  Because I wish I had been born into a world when this is not necessary\r\n\
  This context of struggle and being a warrior and being a struggler\r\n\
  Has been forced on me by opression\r\n\
  Otherwise I would have been a sculptor or a gardener\r\n\
  Carpenter - you know, I would be free to be so much more...\r\n\
  I guess being part of me or part of who I am, a part of what I do\r\n\
  Is being a warrior - a reluctant warrior, a reluctant struggler\r\n\
  But... I do it because I am committed to life\r\n\
  We can't avoid it. We can't run away from it\r\n\
  Because to do that is to be subservient... to devils\r\n\
  Subservient to evil and so that the only way to live on this planet with any human dignity at the moment is to struggle \r\n\
  Subservient to evil and so that the only way to live on this planet with any human dignity at the moment is to struggle "

I'll be honest with you
I hate war in all it's forms -
Physical, psychological, spiritual.... emotional... environmental
I hate war...
And I hate having to struggle - I honestly do
Because I wish I had been born into a world when this is not necessary
This context of struggle and being a warrior and being a struggler
Has been forced on me by opression
Otherwise I would have been a sculptor or a gardener
Carpenter - you know, I would be free to be so much more...
I guess being part of me or part of who I am, a part of what I do
Is being a warrior - a reluctant warrior, a reluctant struggler
But... I do it because I am committed to life
We can't avoid it. We can't run away from it
Because to do that is to be subservient... to devils
Subservient to evil and so that the only way to live on this planet with any human dignity at the moment is to struggle
