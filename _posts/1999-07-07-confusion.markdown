title: Confusion
excerpt: I think New Order's <I>Confusion</I> (the remix on the <EM>Blade</EM> soundtrack) is my new theme song.  I think I'll need to actually purchase this CD, just so I can play it wherever I happen to be.  I mean really, next year, I'm going to be a net tech... I'll need to work on people's computers... and listen to my theme song.  I mean... it's my theme song... that's what you do... you listen.
