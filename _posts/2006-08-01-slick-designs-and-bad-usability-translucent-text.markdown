Not to pick on the [Minneapolis Public Library][mpl] *again*... but they are really good at featuring [usability flaws][1].  This one is also related to doors, and can very easily be related to web and software usability (if you can't tell, web and software usability are the exact same things as the usability of everyday things).

Unfortunately I didn't have my digital camera, but the Emergency Exit doors at the [Minneapolis Public Library][mpl] feature a translucent stenciling that says, "Emergency Exit" or "Emergency Exit Only."  Of course, it was very easy to gloss over this important note attached to the door, after all, the door looked fairly ordinary, and opening it would seemingly bridge access from one area of the building to another, therefore inviting one and all to open it.  The cautionary notice about it being for Emergencies is easily dismissible.

As a matter of fact, you know the nice translucent sign was failing to notify people when a laser-printed notice was taped to each and every emergency exit as a label.

Obviously the designers were going for aesthetic.  "Sure, we need an Emergency Exit, but it doesn't have to stick out."  In the real world, it seems people preferred having no aesthetics (laser printed sheets of paper are temporary, right) and usability over aesthetics and fire-alarms.  

The closest thing I can think of in the electronic world is the "close" feature of an application or a pop-up window.  If it says close, you know what it means.  If it's an "X" you know what it means.  If it's in "red" and "red" isn't part of the design, you know to maybe read what you're doing first.  But if we decide to have the close button look really pretty and part of that design means not labeling it or coloring it different from ... oh let's say the "maximize window" button.  It's easy to see how much user-frustration you can cause.

I really wish I was there to see just how many times that Emergency Door was pushed before some library staff decided to whip open Microsoft Word and type in the largest font possible "Emergency Exit Only" and Scotch tape it on that door.
