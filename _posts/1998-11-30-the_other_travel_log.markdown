  <b><tt>This is from yesterday while I was at DTW:</tt></b>
  <p>
  My flight landed ~5:26 in DTW.  I decided to walk to gate G10 from C12.  Its a long haul.  I'd do it again though if I have no carry on suitcase.  My flight for CMI leaves at 6:50.  I dislike waiting this long.  I ate at a bagel shop.  It was okay.  Hopefully I'll get to CMI and have a ride to my residence hall.  [Note: Thanks to Eric and Karl for rescuing me.]
  <p>The flight to DTW wasn't that great.  I did some math.  I had an irritating person sitting next to me (actually she took my seat, but I didn't care enough to demand my window seat).  [Note: My ride to CMI, I didn't get the window seat that was assigned to me either.]
