The Photo Gallery is still available <a href="http://www135.pair.com/dash/dd/pictures.php3">here</a> (**Update:** link nolonger works, I use [flickr](http://flickr.com/) now).  In the coming weeks I will begin to import it to this new site.<!--more-->The Gallery's been due for an update.  Currently its difficult for me to add new pictures - hence is why their are far to few updates.  The following is technical information.
<p>
Currently I can add new galleries to the photo gallery - which doesn't really show much;)  It is hard to update this system, since I work full time and am usually out of town on weekends.  If I can squeeze some time in I will get the admin system for adding in individual photos to each gallery by the end of next week.  A week from that I should have at least a crude version of the photo-gallery working.  It'll prolly take me a few more weeks on top of all that to import it into this new site - and make it look pretty ;)
