title: Cyclone...
excerpt: |-
  A lot of bad news has come about to many people this weekend.  Here's my share.  There was a massive cyclone in my parent's homestate in India.  My brother was the one to bear the news, however, that my father's home (where my brother spent his first 6 years) was partially destroyed.  Only my uncle and aunt lived there, but they were in the city during the cyclone.  It's more of a sentimental loss than anything, especially for my brother and parents.
  <P>Talking on the phone now.  It's not as bad as it sounds for us.  However, the rest of the area seems really in bad shape. :(
