One of the things I've heard from other fathers is that they love
bottle-feeding.  *I* hate it.

We've introduced a bottle of pumped breast milk so that we can hire a baby
sitter when Katie has doctor's appointments, or when we decide to have a date
night.  Recently, I've had a difficult time feeding him.  He initially took to
the bottle alright, although he fussed anytime I had to adjust his position or
wipe him with a burp rag.  This past weekend was another matter altogether.  I
had zero luck feeding him, but Katie, after nursing him, got him to take the
bottle.  Even good feedings are cumbersome and slow, and involved lots of
spilled milk.

Strangely enough, I enjoy diaper changing time.  If you asked me before the
pregnancy, when I was so naive, what I'd be dreading, I would have said
diapers.  Turns out, diapers are easy at this stage.  Old one comes off, new
one goes on.  There is some form of wiping that has to happen in many cases,
but all in all it's no big deal.  What makes it enjoyable is that Siddhartha is
generally very happy at the changing table.

I'm sure as Siddhartha grows up bottle-time will be easier:

* More fluid hand movements will mean he'll stop whacking the bottle out of his
  mouth.
* Being able to sit him up will make help regulate the milk flow better.
* Him being less temperamental will make him not fuss on the bottle or when it
  gets removed.

What do other infant-dad's enjoy?
