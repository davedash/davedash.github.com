title: No Molly Day 4
excerpt: |-
  Yesterday went well.  I saw <i>Taming of the Shrew</i> presented by Shakespeare in the Park.  They are a very good crew, and they are very funny.  I was surprisingly able to keep up with the play even though I don't recall reading it, although I do remember the name Bianca.  Laureen, Adam, Katie, Jesse and Jesse's cousin watched it with me.  Laureen and I were debating who was prettier, Bianca or Kate.  I said Bianca was.<p>
  We saw other people in the audience too.  We saw Jurewicz (former AP Euro teacher).  We saw Katie's parents (credits to Laureen for spotting Katie's dad).  We later met with Zach and his person, Dan Lavenda and Ryan Hayle (who completely missed the show somehow).<p>
  We went to D'amico's and then Sabastian Joe's for food and Ice Cream.  It was a nice day.<p>
  I am looking forward to the comedy thing on 9 August.
