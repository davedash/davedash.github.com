title: "From: 8 February 1999, After Math"
excerpt: |
  You have tow wonder what drives me to the "Math" portion of "Math/CS" (my major).  It felt nice when one of the heads of the math department (I believe it was actually the head of Undergraduate Mathematics) says "We don't see a lot of [Math/CS students] here."  You know something is flawed when pure research isn't justified with the glass buildings.  The application of mathematics and the sciences, however, is a wonderland.  I refer to Computer Science, the other half of my major.  DCL is this wonderfully renovated building while Altgeld is this chaotic building where the height of the floor changes and everything is "all weird and shit."  This makes mathematics an unappealing major.  Fortunately the love of mathematics can make "all weird and shit" a good thing.  Math is an incredible subject.  There's so much to learn and it all stays the same.  C S is similar, but Math is everywhere.  It's in the machines.  It's in the music.  It's in the science.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate the math opportunities with which I have been presented and with those that surround me.  When people see that I'm a C S major they know or think they know everything about me.  When I say I'm a math major they think I'm "all weird and shit."  Which is nicer than being called the "computer guru" all the time.
