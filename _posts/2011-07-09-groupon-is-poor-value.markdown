I bought a $30 coupon to Hobee's for $15.  I spent $67 with friends.  However,
since we ordered 2 $9 mimosas at half off, we couldn't use the Groupon.  Rather
than Hobee's accepting the fact that I spent well over $30, they charged me the
full price for the Mimosas, making my net savings at Hobee's $6.  That's less
than 10% of my total bill.

This isn't the first time this has happened to me.  Tandori Oven of San Jos√©
and even my beloved the Mmoon have weaseled out of Groupon's or similar by
negating anything that remotely seems like a deal at their stores.

I feel like a bunch of restaurant owners bought into the "Groupon" marketing
concept and saw their (I imagine) already slim margins, get even slimmer - so
they are making Groupons unusable.

Here's the math, as I've understood it:

* You buy a coupon: $10 for $20 of an item.
* Groupon gets $5, the store gets $5.
* The store is effectively discounting something by up to 75%.

What these stores fail to understand:

* I'm discounting my meal by a non-trivial amount.
* In return I buy more than I need to.
* I also tip their employees a bit more.
* I will stop going to their store if they attempt to nickel and dime me.

So I'm going to hold off on Groupons unless I go somewhere where I always pay
the same price and they have no "specials" or "deals" that I might get side
tracked with.  The process is a horrible user-experience, for moderate savings.
