title: The things that CS classes influence you to do.
excerpt: You may have noticed that the updates are getting sparse and few.  I find myself having less time each day to complete my homework, work and this web site.  I am also running out of money to support the site.  So this may be the last update for a while until I can muster enough time to really post my thoughts, etc.  That will probably be in the summer.  Also this depends if I can get enough money to support the site.  I'll see what happens.  Thanks everybody.  If you have more questions, just email me.
