title: Go offline
excerpt: |-
  I just read this article about some guy who spent five days "living" soley on the internet.  That is about the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.  I don't understand what point they are trying to prove?  Just because people are doing more and more things on the internet doesn't mean we will eventually live out our existance on the internet.  There will always (I might be wrong) people who will want to be offline, or do things other than surf the net and check email.  Who on earth can confine themselves to a little box like a computer?  I shouldn't ask, I know there are people who do that with television.  I know that a lot of people waste time on the net, but seriously... people eventually get tired of sloth and do stuff.  If not, they die.  Natural selection kills off the lazy.
  <P>The future I intend to create and perpetuate as a computer scientist and as a person with ideas is one where machines evolve around people rather than people evolving around machines.  People should enjoy life.  Life is not in that box that sits in front of you.  Life is outside the box.  People shouldn't order pizza online while they work in their home-office at 3:00 AM typing up reports, checking email or coding all night.  People should be ordering gyros from the local greek restaurant on their cellphones at 11:00 am while they rollerblade to work.  If they need to check their email, it will be read to them through a device in their ear in the natural language of their choice.  They can talk to real people at the while they eat their gyro outside on the restaurant's porch.  When they finished eating their food, they can take off their blades and walk to work all the while working off the calories they just injested.
  <P>Stupid Americans... evolve.
