excerpt: |-
  I stumbled on this cool ad on television.  It was from Volkswagon.  What made it cool was they were playing <i>Little Fluffy Clouds</i> from The Orb and they had it synched in such a way that the car colors changed with each beat of the song.  Once again VW has put neat music to their ads.<p>
  On another note, look at <a href="http://www.apple.com/whymac/ads.html">this</a> and then look at <a href="http://www.chick.com/catalog/tractlist.asp">this</a>.  Or maybe look at them the other way around.  Now is it just me or do some of the Apple advertisements have the same tone as the Chick Tracts?
