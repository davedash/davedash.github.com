title: Archive fixed.
excerpt: |-
  I was annoyed at my journal archive's little quirks, so I fixed them.  Currently I am annoyed with my journal system in general and am going to be writing a new one.  The new one will use a more efficient algorithm that decides which entries to display and which ones to not display.  I think I will also lower the bytes displayed, but I'm not quite sure yet.
  <p>I'm unusually busy this week.  I'm currently hanging out at DCL doing all my homework here, because it's a good environment.  (I can see how Peter lived at CMU's computer lab).  This week I've got a few philosophy readings to do.  I've got to write up my physics prelab.  I have to read and do some homework for CS 173.  I have to read up on my Java.  I have some math.  I also have to do some research for SpCom.  I suppose it isn't that much, but I have to work on top of that (for the Inquiry page, Chickscope and MedRx).  I also am doing the guy at coolinfo.com a favor, and my temple's web site needs some tweaks.  Then there is my own web work, which will never see the light of day in the near future.
  It'll be fun combatting all this.  Just about as fun as talking to someone who has a retractable metal rod in her mouth that she uses to poke peoples eyes out.
