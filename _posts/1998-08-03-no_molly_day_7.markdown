excerpt: |-
  I just ordered a Micron 128 MB PC100 SDRAM DIMM of Memory.  I didn't need PC100, but the company who sold it to me, <a href="http://www.concentric.net/~Csplus/">CSP</a>, offered that at a lower price than other companies offered non PC100.  I also ordered a NIC (3COM FastEtherlink XL).  If this stuff sounds cryptic to you, I can explain it.<p>
  If any of you thing your computer is a bit sluggish, now is the time to upgrade your memory.  Typically 64MB is good.  The reason now is a good time, is because memory is dirt cheap, but it is slowly growing more expensive (at least the good brands).
