title: Graph Theory
excerpt: |-
  Oh yeah, I had a test a few nights ago (tuesday) from like 7 PM to 10 PM on Graph Theory. I think I may have passed.  The test seemed remarkably like UMTYMP.  8 problems choose 6.  You are in a classroom with mounted desk/chairs and it's up to three hours long:)  Show all your work.<p>
  
  Tonight I got my haircut obscenely short.  I think it's cool.
