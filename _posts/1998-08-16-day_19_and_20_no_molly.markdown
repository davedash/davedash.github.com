title: Day 19 and 20 No Molly
excerpt: |-
  <a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0%2C4%2C25166%2C00.html?dd.ne.tx.wr">Finally...</a><p>
  Saturday I read a lot of Dune and a lot of <a href="http://www.maximumpcmag.com/">Maximum PC</a>.  It's a very good magazine for anybody who can justify spending more than $2K on a single computer.  Later Marc and his Anime buddies and I went to Arby's to eat and on the way I dropped stuff off at Molly's house.  Her room smells funny.<p>Then we went to Adam's party which was moderately okay.  I dislike parties because nothing really happens and nobody talks to me, because I am either insane or because I don't like them.  For the most part it's the former.  The party ended early and Adam, Hayley and I went to my house.  Marc came over later.  Then Hayley left.  Then Marc and I played Mario.  Then I played Solstice.  I played until 2AM or more.  We were going to watch <i>Kentucky Fried Movie</i> but Marc and I were too tired to focus.  My phone rang throughout the night because a family member passed away and people felt the need to call me and tell me while I tried to sleep.  Eventually I gave in and just stayed awake (it was about 10:30 AM).  Eventually Marc and Adam woke up and we all made pancakes and had fun.  Then we watched <i>Dune</i> in the evening.  I hate that movie.  It's differs too much from the book for my liking.
