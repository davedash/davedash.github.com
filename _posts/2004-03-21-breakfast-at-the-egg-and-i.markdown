Somedays are better than others.  Today was better.  Marc came over and we picked up Brian and Hayley and were going to go to Cafe Ibiza.  Cafe Ibiza was closed so we detoured to Egg and I.  It was a lot of driving but it was worth it.  We were seven people eating breakfast today.  Much fun.  Others may join us Sunday (next week) as well just email me at breakfast-rulez (at) davedash.com

I'm not surprised Ibiza closed.  They replaced Pasquals, which was my favorite restaurant.  They had a lousy day-to-day food selection, but the breakfast was awesome.  Katie says the Hot Chocolate was awesome too.  Hopefully something good will take its place.  Something run by people with better restaurant experience.
