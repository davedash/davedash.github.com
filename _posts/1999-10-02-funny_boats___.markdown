title: Funny boats...
excerpt: |-
  Today I went on an Allen Hall trip to Turkey Run State Park (in Indiana).  It was a lot of fun.  We noticed some Amish people there and <A HREF='http://www.uiuc.edu/~sdhughes/'>Scott</A> and I wondered why they were at the park.  To get away from it all?
  <P>Scott and I went canoeing.  It was fun.  Scott was inexperienced and I was too for the most part.  I did teach my self how to steer though.  We eventually made it (we weren't last in our group so it was all good) despite all the collisions with rocks, logs and what not.  The water there was too shallow.  Canoeing rules... heh funny boats.
