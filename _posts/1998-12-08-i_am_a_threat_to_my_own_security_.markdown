  I want to see Patch Adams this weekend.  I just might do that.  I also want to see <a href="http://www.startrek.com/">Star Trek: Insurrection</a>.  I think I want a gun.  A ray gun...
  <p><a href="http://www.coolinfo.com/">Cool Info</a> is moving to <a href="http://www.pair.com/">pair networks</a>.  I will be working on a news article entry system that mimics what I use right now.  I'll work on it over break.
  <p>I use my workstation as a development machine for my web pages via Front Page and the Personal Web Server.  The root page used to be an old web site that I had for Fort Max that I only developed on my computer and uploaded to the Internet.  It was very corporate sounding, back when I cared about that stuff for ftmax.com.  It never occuured to me that if CCSO did a scan of my computer, they would notice that my workstation is the host of a corporate web site.  Here is some mail:

  I have noticed that the machine 130.126.72.54 has a web page for a commercial
  entity. This is strictly in violation of university policy and state law.
  
  If this page is not removed immediately, your network connection will be 
  disabled and student discipline charges filed.

  Don't bother entering that address, there's nothing there, since I deleted the site (it was a dated one that I never used) and locked it.  It's so strange some of the things that I take for granted can be stripped away so fast.
  
  <p>I finished reading <i>Xenocide</i>.  Very Deux Ex Machina, I've heard bad things about <i>Children of the Mind</i> as well.  I can imagine why.  I will, however, finish reading the series as I am curious as to what Mr. Card is trying to achieve.  I did like the book.  I read at least over 100 pages on one day.

  <a href="http://www.theonion.com/">The Onion</a> will have an <a href="http://www.upside.com/texis/mvm/susan_karlin?id=366713ca0">MTV Christmas Special</a> supposedly.  This should be interesting, hopefully someone will record this for me.  It's funny, Onion is one of the better sources of humour, we need more things like that on TV.  Canadian TV has funny stuff that crosses the line, as does British TV.  It's in our best interest to mimic these, instead of remaining prudish about our humour.  Damn you America for spawning crap like SNL and MAD TV.
  <p>Since I have no original ideas, here's my Christ Day wish list:
  <ol><li>Sony Netman or Diamond Rio PMP300
      <li>PCS Cellular phone with cellular service for one year (so next year someone else can get me a year of service)
      <li>IBM Laptop SCSI whatever you can or a DELL Inspirion must have DVD support
      <li>SGI 1600SW with Number Nine card
      <li>SONY DCR-PC10
      <li>Soundblaster Live
      <li>UMAX PowerLook 3000
      <li>Lego Mindworks
      <li>Something with a pretty LCD screen that goes on my computer.
  <li>A ray gun.
  </ol>
  That's my Christmas want list.  It's unlikely that I'd ever get any of these (for Christmas this year) since most things are in the $1000+ range.  I will however go for the laptop this summer (with DVD support) if you people fail to appease me.  If you do get me an LCD toy, it better be pretty.  None of that stupid LCD stuff.
  <p>I ate at Burger King yesterday.  It was very good after a disconcerting school dinner.  I shall eat out more often.  I will try to avoid Burger King for a while.  Their sandwhiches are good, but they are the kind that make you not want to eat their for a few months.
