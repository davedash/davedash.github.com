  So, I've been in Schaumburg, IL for the last week, and I'll be here until December, I believe.  If you are ever in the Chicago area, contact me.  Anyway, I'm working for Motorola Labs in the Applications Research division.  It's a lot of fun.  Hopefully it'll continue to be fun.
  <p>
  I got to see some friends yesterday (Ahmed &c.) and we went to the <a href="http://www.depaul.edu/">DePaul</a> MESA conference on Human Rights in the Middle East.  It was very informative, and as always... well sad.  Palestine or rather the Palestinians are in a sad shape, but I've made that clear several times.
