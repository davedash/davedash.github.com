  I came up with this neat idea, that I might hope to expand on later.  Many of us who are fairly adept with using computers tend to come across at least a few people who are very unskilled at using a computer and often treat it as a delicate insrument that at anytime may cease to function and thus must never be experimented with beyond the ways which they are taught.  Say that seven times fast.  No, really do it.  Say it and record it and then send it to me.  The problem with this relationship with a computer you become computer-illiterate.  Which isn't a bad thing, except you can't get things done.  This is why software needs to be by default very wizard like.  Not the stupid paper-clip in office, but Kit from <i>Knight Rider</i>, Jane from <i>Speaker for the Dead</i>, Computer from <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>, Holly from <i>Red Dwarf</i> and to a lesser extent the organism from <i>Sphere</i> that took over the computer and made everyone want to kill everyone else (with none of the killing of course).  The main reason for making computers like that, is that they have a persona and they do things for you.  You communicate to the computer like you would communicate with a friend or slave.  For those of us who would rather not have that, we could disable it.  Please support Artificial Intelligence.
  
  <p>My dorm light went good-bye.  I work in darkness now.  Actually I work in the bask of a florescent study lamp from Jack's desk which is adequate for computer work.  What errors I encounter will be adjusted through corrective surgery...
  
  <p>By the way, the song that I said was really cool is actually Jeane Michael Jarre's <i>Oxygene 16</i> performed live in Moscow... I found most of the concert live, but only this track was 128/44 (and mislabled).  I've uploaded all my stuff to the MP3 server.  I've listened to a few of his other works and they are okay, but none were as impressive as this.  Of course this is also the only good MP3 I could find of him (a mislabeled one at that).
  
  <p>There exists a World Jewish Congres... WJC... hmm... interesting.  Sounds a little too much like World Wide Jewsih Conspiracy to me.
  
  <p>I've noticed a lot of people on my dorm leave their TV on, and don't actually watch it.  It might be laziness or it might be some type of "security" that they get from the TV being on.  I know that the TV gives me "company" when I eat alone at home, but I rarely do that anymore.  This might be for the same reason.  So I ask:
  <FORM target=_self METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://www.ftmax.com/vote/cgi-bin/survey.cgi">
    <input type=hidden name=action value="VOTE">
    <input type=hidden name=filebase value="tvhabits">
  Do you keep your televion on even if you are not watching it?
  <p>   <input type=radio name=ITEM1 value="0">Yes.
  <br>   <input type=radio name=ITEM1 value="1">No.
  <p> <INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Vote"></FORM><FORM METHOD="POST" target=_self ACTION="http://www.ftmax.com/vote/cgi-bin/survey.cgi"><input type=hidden name=action value="VIEW"><input type=hidden name=filebase value="tvhabits"><INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="View Results">
  </form>
  <p>A lot of my friends here on campus have older computers that require non-SDRAM, either EDO or the "other kind."  If someone can point me in the direction of how to distinguish between the types of RAM, that'd be great.  Also, if any of you have this type of RAM lying around, please give it to me.
  <p>Now you may be thinking, "Dave, you're all the way in Urbana."  I'm coming back Tuesday and their is a Thanksgiving Party at my house this Friday.  All are welcome, just email me so I know you're coming.  It's best to <a href="mailto:rsvp@ftmax.com">let me know</a> if you're coming by Tuesday night for sure.  If you've already told me that you are coming, then don't worry.  Thanks a lot.  Hope to see you soon.  And to all my friends living on the east and west coasts, hope to see many of you during Winter Break.  Unless I hate you.  Email me if you want to know if I hate you.
