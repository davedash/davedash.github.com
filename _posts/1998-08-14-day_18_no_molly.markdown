excerpt: |-
  ZDTV is the ultimate TV channel.
    
  Today (or maybe yesterday) they featured the <a href="http://www.tmbg.com/">They Might Be Giants</a> web site.  They even played the <i>Broom</i> video.<p>
  On todays show they will apparently have <a href="http://www.afrosquad.com/">Afrosquad</a>'s site featured.<p>
  Looks like I may not take the Japanese test this Thursday.  I hate the Japanese teachers because they don't understand anything.  I want to take Japanese, but not as a major, and that doesn't seem to click for them.  Sure I've only communicated with one sensei, but making an over-generalization is easier than talking to all the Japanese teachers.<p>It also appears I can get to my hall on the day I need to be there.
  <p><a href="http://www.spaceghost.com/">Space Ghost from Coast to Coast</a> is this rehashed cartoon from the 60s that is doing a talk-show.  It's mildly funny.  Last week I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Today they did this cool thing where the first show ended with John Hensen from Talk Soup.  So basically they had the first half of the show appear to be just a clip from Talk Soup.  Which was amusing.  Talk Soup is a comical TV show from <a href="http://www.eonline.com/">E!</a> that satirizes Talk Shows (night and day).
