excerpt: |
  I have created a generic template of the new site.  I installed PHP3, 
  which I use to do scripting, on my computer and am playing with 
  things locally.  Basically I can re-organize my page any which way I 
  want to with only modifying a line or two of code.  So I guess my next
  step is working on the mySQL database.
