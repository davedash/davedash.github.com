This month has been my favorite thus far.  The first month was exciting, but
nerve racking.  Two was full of changes.  Three was somewhat boring, but we did
get sleep.  Four we lost all our sleep.  In this month a lot of stuff happened
and we got used to the [sleep regression][4].

This month we are also sleeping differently.  He sleeps around 7 or 8PM and
wakes up a few times at night.  We sleep around 9 or 10PM.  Katie nurses him in
bed the first few times he wakes.  Once it's 4am I take him out so Katie can
get an hour or two of uninterrupted sleep (or more on the weekend).  I'll
either get him to fall back asleep on me in the couch or in his swing.
Sometimes I'll need to change his diaper, or bottle feed him a bit.

But the sleep regression wasn't all for naught.  He now rolls, which is
amazing, and he can army crawl:

I think I'll be spending a lot of weekends hiding wires and cables and other
things that babies think are delicious.  Crawling (and perhaps teething) have
led to a lot more spit-up too.

My biggest problem has been one of scheduling.  I wake up around 5 or 6AM, get
ready for work, wait for Katie to get ready, then go to work, come back around
6PM and start putting him to sleep.  I don't get enough time to spend with him
on weekdays, and I feel like I'm rushing to and from a job I really enjoy.  I'm
really hoping that he gets to sleep easier, so I won't feel rushed each day.

In any case, this next month should be exciting - our plan is to give this guy
an avocado for Thanksgiving.
