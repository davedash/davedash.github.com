Raj and Kelly have finally acquired the building that is to become my base of operations for the summer and hopefully onwards.  This building has two apartments and office space.  Ryan and I will occupy the apartments respectively and run Spin Drop in the office space.<!--more-->Spin Drop will be our stab at running our own computer consulting business.  We will initially focus on computer networking and web design.

For myself it will be living in an ideal place.  I've always wanted to live in Uptown, Minneapolis.  Its close to the lakes, and I can rollerblade to any place I need to go.

Additionally I'll be able to take advantage of the progressive political atmosphere in Minnesota, and work with any grassroots efforts that interest me - or even start my own.
