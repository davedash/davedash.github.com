It wasn't until recently that I started to pay more attention to Steve Jobs.

Watching movies and reading books, I pieced together how influential Apple was
in my life and how much Steve Jobs was a driver for Apple.

I don't agree with everything he does, or everything Apple does and continues
to do, but the net effect is positive on my life.

I went to school in Minnesota, much of my school was influenced by [MECC][],
which did a lot to bring Apple's into our classrooms, and classics like Number
Munchers and Oregon Trail.  I remember at a young age wanting a Macintosh and
eventually I was convinced that what I wanted was a Windows 3.1 machine that
could run some excellent DOS games.

Much of my later childhood was severely Windowy, and it wasn't until I was
about to graduate that I got my first Titanium Powerbook.  Now I have Apple
devices everywhere, and have a tough time helping people who don't use Apple
products.  I can jump back in time and see the wonderful UX I know and love in
my current Apple world had its roots in those computers I played with at
school, and even those weird black NeXT boxes they had in some computer labs at
the University of Minnesota.

The world of computing and user experience is less dismal too.  Windows and
Android and all the competitors of Apple are all better, even if they are only
playing catchup.

So I intend to remember Steve, not by buying the next gadget that Apple churns
out, but by always striving to create a better world.
