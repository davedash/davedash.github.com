  Here is a funny response to my AOL-ICQ mass message:<pre>
  Are you serious? 
  I already knew that they 
  were being bought out, but 
  is it really true that 
  they'll charge? 
  </pre>
  I saw our school's fourth annual Unplugged.  There was a lot of good stuff and a lot of dull stuff.  I'll point out the good.  There was a good song called "Tune" by the Cahsta Ricans.  Which was this guy on the violin or some stupid string instrument.  There was a silly 50s-ish song called "Wishin and Hopin" that was just silly and made females seem inferior.  Zach Held did a song called Closer.  I slept for a bit and woke up to Neil Young's <i>Old Man</i> as done by Mr. Carlson on banjo and Susan Anderson on Guitar and some other guy on some other instrument.  Very good stuff.  Post Intermission:  There was Spaghetti Eatin Disco Bears with <i>Hydroponic Beats for the Soul</i>.  That was the coolest thing I heard all night.  It was a lot of good percussion.  Some people did a good version of Layla.  There were a few other good ones.  Peter Seals, Jacob Greene and Dan Thomas did an excelent version of Simple Mind's <i>Don't you forget about me</i>.  That's about it.
