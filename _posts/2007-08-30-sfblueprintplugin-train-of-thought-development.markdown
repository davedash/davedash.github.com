I've been creating some dummy projects for my presentations at [SymfonyCamp][sc] and decided now would be a good time to learn using the Blueprint CSS framework.  It's a bit different than YUI which I've been using heavily, but it has some potential.

Of course, instead of just downloading the framework, I made [a plugin][b] for symfony.  It's not much yet, but eventually I'll throw in some helpers.

Enjoy!
