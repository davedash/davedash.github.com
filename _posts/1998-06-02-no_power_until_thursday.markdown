title: No power until Thursday?
excerpt: |-
  Obviously my math does not model reality... well I didn't expect it too do so.<blockquote><i>
  Northern States Power Co. says it expects to have power back on by late Thursday for most of the the 89,000 customers still without it as of Monday afternoon. NSP says a few areas might not have power restored until Friday.<i><p>from <a href="http://www.pioneerplanet.com/">Pioneer Planet</a></blockquote>
  Hopefully I can return to my home for more than ten hours.  You know, it's really cold in the morning... you'd not expect that in this season.  It's annoying, because I usually have one or two computers running in my office room that keep me warm.<p>Well anyway, I have the final diagram of how my program works written out.  It should be done tonight... I work more efficiently at the Borcherts because there are less things to distract me (or something).
