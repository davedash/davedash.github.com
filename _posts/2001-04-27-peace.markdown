  Yes... I stayed up all night to see if <a href="http://www.dailyillini.com/apr01/apr27/opinions/stories/letter03.shtml">this</a>
  would get published.  It did.  I am happy.  It was poorly written, basically putting a few key points into from my last post into a letter to the editor.  I've got another letter for them to send later today to appear in Monday, insha'allah.  
  <p>Anyway, protesting Israeli occupation of Palestine was wonderful.  My throat hurts but I was able to stand together with brothers and sisters fighting for what I feel is a fight for justice.  I miss my progressive Minnesotans though.  I know that many of them would have wonderous views to share on a campus as great as ours.</p>
  <p>
  I encourage everybody to Get Up, Stand Up.  Fight for rights.  Even your rights are being taken away with New World Order like trade agreements like the FTAA, WTO, etc.  At the same time, try to support the cause of the other people as well.  Today was great because we had people stand together with us that weren't Muslim or Palestinian (myself for example), but even people who didn't plan on it.  Wonderful people.
