title: bored
excerpt: Currently I am doing absolutely nothing.  I'm not in too good of a situation at all.  I didn't wake up early because I have nothing to do.  I sometimes write thank you notes, but that gets boring.  Sometimes I read, but I've read a lot recently and am resting.  I don't enjoy television and it is too gloomy outside to do any house work.<p>I'm not a good people person so I don't have that many friends I guess, well most of the ones I have I guess don't have a car or have a job or something.  So I really have nothing to do.  I don't like doing things in front of a computer either.<p>Tomorrow I go to Valley Fair with Molly and Laureen.  That should be fun.  I haven't been to Valley Fair with Laureen for five years.  I wish Marc Gutman were in town.  He'd know what to do...<p>Oh goddammit, I really wish he was in town... because I just came up with this cool-ass idea.  Get a whole bunch of cardboard and build a people sized icosahedron that would be stable enough to like be inside.  Heck even if you couldn't be inside it, it would be neat.  I guess I'll just be waiting for Gutman.
