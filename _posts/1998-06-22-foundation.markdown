title: Foundation
excerpt: I have finally finished Asimov's Foundation series.  I do agree with <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ywong/">Yishan</a>, this is perhaps the best book in the series.  I like how by the end of the book I could figure out what that cube in the picture was (but I have no clue as to who is holding it).  I like the vague reference to where Star's End actually is.  The bit about the Prime Radiant going to Terminus is interesting too... I mean they never mentioned anything in the Foundation series about a foreign black cube that displays complex mathematical equations.<p>I wonder if mathematicians like the series due to the whole mathematical foundation...<p>I don't work until Wednesday where I am forced to help kids at Valley Fair.
