title: Fourth of July Weekend
excerpt: |-
  This weekend was not too bad.  We had Convergence, the brand new science fiction convention, and it went well.  I think with a little more work and participation it will turn out to be a great thing.  <a href='http://www.engelbot.com/'>Adam</a> said he was going to do a write up of the con, so that may be on his web site.
  <P>
  Saturday night, we (Molly, Adam and I) went to see comedy groups known as Soylent Theatre (who also performed at Minicon), the Impossibles (featuring the one and only <a href='http://www.dougshaw.com'>Doug!</A>) and another group Opera something... anyway they were good.  I know soon I'll get an email from Doug saying I screwed something up in this entry.
  <P>
  I also went to Lake Minnetonka for fireworks.  It wasn't worth it.  The fireworks were not impressive in the very least.
  <P>
  The weekend was good... now to work on a calendar for the site.
