title: Site Statistics for October
excerpt: |-
  Overall in the last few weeks, I've been getting more hits.
  <ul><li>13190 hits for the site, 1363 user sessions for the site.
  <li>I had 45 user sessions per day (439 hits), this is probably artificially inflated since I and others probably check the page a couple times a day.
  <li>455 hits for the main page, 412 user sessions
  <li>This journal wasn't viewed enough.  I am considering redoing the site to change that.  The friends page was viewed more (63 hits/57 user sessions).</li>
  <FORM target=_self METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://www.ftmax.com/vote/cgi-bin/survey.cgi">
    <input type=hidden name=action value="VOTE">
    <input type=hidden name=filebase value="openjournal">
    Should <a href="http://www.ftmax.com/" target=_top>http://www.ftmax.com</a> open with the Journal in the main frame, or should it be left as is?
  <p>   <input type=radio name=ITEM1 value="0">Yes, the Journal is why most people come here.
  <br>   <input type=radio name=ITEM1 value="1">No, I like the way it is now.
  <br>   <input type=radio name=ITEM1 value="2">I don't care.
  <p> <INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Vote"></FORM><FORM METHOD="POST" target=_self ACTION="http://www.ftmax.com/vote/cgi-bin/survey.cgi"><input type=hidden name=action value="VIEW"><input type=hidden name=filebase value="openjournal"><INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="View Results">
  </form>
  <li>Most user sessions come from me and some of my friends here.  Actually I know a few of them look around my site, so not all the hits are from me.
  <li>The following ranking for user sessions is as follow: U of M, UW, Caltech, NYU, CMU, Visi.com (a local ISP in MN), Uswest.com (Kay's ISP), Dan Lavenda and finally a computer named ZENO.  Their is only one computer I know of by the name of ZENO, and that is Tom's dad's.
  <li>The top referring sites are Tom's page, Adam's page, Ben Schack's page, and Yishan's news page.
  <li>Most people use Internet Explorer.
  <li>Most people use Windows 95, with a close following by "Others."
