Working at Delicious with the team has been a wonderful experience.  This is probably the most fun I've had working on a project.  I am really glad to work on a site that I use almost daily (and regularly if not daily before I joined) with a [team that really cares about their product][t].

So without further ado... 

[Delicious 2.0][d]

Here's [the official announcement][b].
