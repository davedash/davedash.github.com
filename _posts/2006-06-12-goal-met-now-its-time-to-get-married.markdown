160 pounds.

That was my goal weight for [my wedding](http://ktdd.org/) date, and I made it.  There's been a lot of interested parties as to how I lost my weight, apparently it's visibly noticable.  My pants are much looser too.  And of course, I feel lighter.

As to what I did, it's not all to different than [Jeremy](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/006836.html)'s approach.  Although I knew I didn't want to rigidly count calories.  After the wedding, I'll try to concisely reveal what it is I did to lose weight, since a lot of friends and family have asked.

As for the wedding, things are coming together, and I am **very** excited.  It'll be a blast.  A lavish blast, but still a blast.  Katie and I can't wait to see all of you who are coming in town.
