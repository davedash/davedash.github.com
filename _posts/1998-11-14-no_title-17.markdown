  I'm reading some news off the AP wire.  Xis Vwj is pronounced "See Voo."  In one light, that's pretty cool.  On the otherhand, who the hell is responsible for translating Hmong (I think) to English?
  <p>This if from the AFP:
  <blockquote>
  <tt>
     WASHINGTON, Nov 9 (AFP) - Inspired by the victory in the  
  Minnesota governor's race of former pro wrestler Jesse Ventura, 
  another veteran of the sport, Hulk Hogan, plans to run for
  president in 2000, Time magazine says. 
  <br>   "When Jesse won, I said to my wife, 'I'm 10 times more popular  
  than him,'" Hogan told Time. 
  <br>   "People know Hulk Hogan like they know McDonald's and  
  Chevrolet." 
  <br>   The weekly said Hogan planned to approach billionaire Ross  
  Perot, CNN founder Ted Turner and talk show queen Oprah Winfrey
  as possible running mates. 
  <br>   Asked of a possible political contest against Ventura, Hogan 
  said, "I'd like to get him into the ring and basically stomp on 
  him." 
  </tt>     
  </blockquote>
  This is what I feared might happen in the last paragraph of my essay.  Luckily, Hulk Hogan, although popular, is not nearly as charismatic as Jesse the Body.  
  <p>I finished <i>I, Robot</i> some time ago.  It's a childrens novel.  Well it seems like one.  The future it portrays is interesting and their are portions that are probable.  I, personally, think that we will have powerful thinking machines far sooner than actual robots.
  <p>I have begun reading <i>Ender's Game</i>.  I understand why <a href="http://www.engelbot.com/">Adam</a> liked it so much.  This summer I worked with gifted (well if not gifted, talented) children in a mathematics program with Molly.  You could always single out that even among these there is still the quiet ones and the smart ones and the quiet and smart ones.  I also like how it reminds me of my childhood.  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="right" width="80%"

I politely asked some kid, one year my senior, if I could sit with him.  He didn't give me a valid reason why I couldn't.  I decided since this kid wasn't exactly someone to fear that I should just elbow him in the stomach and take a seat.  My plan worked.  It's not that I was violent, it's that I decided that was the best choice for my situation.  I sometimes miss my childhood.  When you are picked on as a child, beating the crap out of someone is an option.  Now that I'm grown up, there are legal issues with beating the crap out of people.  People are also more civil towards one another.
  
  
  <p>Stinky has over six hours of video of the #2 <i>Street Fighter</i> player in the world.  He watches it intently.

Stinky attempted to exclaim how cool it was by saying that this was the number 2 player.  My friend, Tim, responded with "So?"

I doubt they are going to be doing anything that is visually stunning, and justifying it by saying that they are the #1 computers as far as computing speed goes doesn't mean crap.
  
  <p>For fear that my floor may come off, I started <a href="http://www.manco.com/">duct-taping</a> it.  This duct-tape exo-floor should be more durable and less likely to come off.  That's right people... I'm still strange.  Actually I'm not going to tape my entire floor lest I incur the wrath of some building inspectors.
  
  <p>I'm experiencing another joyous no-Stinky weekend.  With Stinky gone, I decided to fix the biggify thing so it prompts you and stores it as a cookie propperly.  Previously it was using someone elses code that I slightly modified.  Now a more modified code that makes more sense to me.  I love programming.
