  I find this disaster that has scattered the news so fast very disturbing.  
  These people sound like my friends from highschool, except my friends would 
  not kill and weren't neo-Nazi's.  Very, very sad.  Everytime a  shooting like this 
  occurs, I wonder why in this country?  Only this country.  We are messed 
  up beyond belief.

  No more Dave for today.
