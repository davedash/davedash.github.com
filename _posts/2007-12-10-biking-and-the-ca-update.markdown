People keep asking me how things are going in CA.

They are going well.

### Biking

I finally told myself I need to start biking more.  So I biked to work... all the way (normally I bike to the Mountain View caltrain station and take a shuttle to my work).  It was 8.6 miles of bike lanes everywhere.  
I went [this-a-way](http://del.icio.us/davedash/route+mv+mc).  I totally felt like a champion.  There was a few scary parts, one where I had to cross over an on ramp.  It wasn't too bad.  Then there was a scary part where I cross four lanes of traffic.  [See here.](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&msa=0&msid=
107218167367262908527.000440f1316d7d62009e9)  I made it in at about the same time I normally came in and I didn't leave too much earlier.

Of course this really was nothing compared to yesterday when Katie and I met our friend Al at a halfway point in San Mateo... about 20 miles from our place (and his).  That was quite a work out and a thrilling ride.  There's so much to see in the Bay Area on our bikes, it's great and there are lanes everywhere.

### Work

Work is fine.  I work at Yahoo! on del.icio.us using the symfony framework.  We're really making it a great product that will not only look great, but perform well as we gain more and more users.  When it launches I can tell you what I worked on :)

Now, we don't get free food like Google does, but it's fairly inexpensive.  We do get free fountain soda and coffee.  By free coffee, I mean its pretty much an inhouse coffee shop that'll make whatever you want.  Every now and then I treat myself to a frapp√© (which incidentally isn't free, it's $2.00).

Also, because people ask.  Yes, I'm allowed to use GMail, Gtalk, Google Maps, etc, etc, etc.  Yes, it's Yahoo! and they do want you to use Yahoo! products, but if you happen to use a competitors product, oh well.

### Home

Our apartment is slowly coming together.  It helped that Katie doesn't have a 9-5.  We've got a couch, and although we're not fully furnished, we have enough of our place ready to entertain guests.

### Outside of Home

We've been rather busy.  Whether it's our good friend Katie Romportl Cook coming down from Sacramento, or other friends coming into town, or events in the city, or just hanging out with our friend Al... we've had a lot to do.  We do a lot of biking, and we're checking out meetup.com.  It's a lot of fun.
