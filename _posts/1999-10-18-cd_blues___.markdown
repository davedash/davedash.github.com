title: CD blues...
excerpt: So I wanted to start using my portable CD player once more.  So I tried to use it with my crappy headphones and it didn't work.  So last night at Meijer I bought new headphones to replace the crappy ones and some batteries.  New batteries didn't help.  So I was without a functional Discman.  This somewhat annoys me.  Luckily Brendon has a more modern Discman that does work.  So I'm using that now with Sony Street Style headphones.  It's awesome.  I like the headphones because they go behind your head and they only use a cord that doesn't split to your left and right ears.  Actually they do split, but it goes through the headband part of the head phones.  The sound is decent (I wasn't asking for too much, just a fairly clean sound).  So I'm happy.  One day when I feel the urge, I may get my own discman and be elite like my roommate.  But until then, I'll bum off him.
