Wednesday we had our <acronym title="University of Minnesota Talented Youth Mathematics Program">UMTYMP</acronym> graduation.  Present were Molly, <a href="http://www.borchert.com/tom/">Tom Borchert</a>, Adam Engelhart, Suzy Reichel, Laureen Ojalvo, Eve Xin, and others.  <a href="http://www.math.umn.edu/~shaw/">Doug Shaw</a> gave an astounding speech.  Suzy also gave a speech which was good.  Raj (my brother) and I did not like the food at all.  Other people said the food was alright, but I think maybe my brother and I have higher standards for food.

Anyway, I got a lot of help for my fourth <acronym title="Computer Science">CSci</acronym> assignment in Recitation.  Recitation was boring so I emailed Katie (**ed:** Romportl - 5/24/06) for the last two minutes.  There's a link, you can email her too (**ed:** there is no link, it was removed in a belated attempt to thwart spam - 5/24/06).  I'm going to start using her as my personal wailing wall.  Except I won't cry.  I'll just babble about how I don't want to be in my classroom at the moment.

When I got home, Molly and I started working on invitations for our graduation.  Hopefully we'll send them out today or on Monday.

Yesterday, Molly and I went to Minnehaha Falls and rain fell on us (which she enjoys more than I) and then hail fell on us (which neither of us enjoy at all).  We ran back to a mini-shelter and then to the car and headed to someplace safe, Arby's.  Molly has sided with me and really likes the Roast Chicken and Pesto Panini Grill sandwich.  We then left for the play at Hopkins (Pirates of Penzance).  I got to talk to the crew and even where a shirt of a crew-member (because mine was sopping wet).  Molly returned to the light, and I found Mike Jorgenson and we sat down and then were joined by Adam and a surprise appearance by Jason Waye.  The play was very good.

We (Molly and I) went home, were tired, started printing labels for the invites.  Then we realized they didn't print what we wanted (well I realized that, Molly was asleep on the couch).  Molly left home, and I went to sleep.

Today I worked on my C++ project a little.  It's not too bad at all.  Tomorrow my dad comes back from India during Simpsons/X-files... I hope his plane gets delayed so I don't miss any of the show.
