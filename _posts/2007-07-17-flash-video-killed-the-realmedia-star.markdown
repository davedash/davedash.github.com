and Quicktime and Windows Media Player... almost.

Embedded flash video is great and plays almost universally on peoples web browsers since the plugin is so widely installed.

Some web sites still insist on supporting plugins for players that just don't work too hot on the web.  CNN still insists on RealMedia or WindowsMedia Player.  It's time to grow up.  RealMedia is dead from an unexperienced enduser's perspective.  WindowsMedia Player doesn't work so great for the Mac.  Flash for the win.

So wake up CNN to the YouTube'd generation.
