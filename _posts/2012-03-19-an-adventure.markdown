I have left the Mozilla Corporation this month.  A lot of people have asked me
why I decided to leave.  To some, a decision like that is unfathomable.
Mozilla has been my favorite place to work ever, so leaving was a difficult
choice.  I've done some things I'm proud of:

* I built out the add-ons search (twice).
* I helped rewrite our add-ons website in Django... and then all our sites.
* I helped us ship solid code with continuous integration.
* I helped grow our team with some solid people (about 20 people were brought
  in or interviewed by me).
* I helped speed up our recruitment process.
* I helped smooth out [our on-boarding process][1].
* I helped [get a few members of PyLadies to DjangoCon][2].

Mozilla made it very easy to do things like this.  It encourages this type of
behavior.  I've had a lot of good mentors, and a lot of great peers.

I also learned quite a bit of python.  Hiring bright python engineers who are
happy to share their knowledge helps.

The folks at [Pinterest][3] proposed an adventure for me.  One where I'll get
to learn quite a bit on the fly, but also take similar initiatives at making
engineering fun and productive.  I'll also be working on a product used by
many people, but more importantly a product that's used by quite a few of my
friends.
