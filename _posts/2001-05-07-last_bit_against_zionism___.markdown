title: Last bit against Zionism...
excerpt: |-
  I used to think that the view that not being extremely
  for Palestine meant that you were pro-Israel was a bit
  harsh.  Then I realized that the default sentiments in
  this country are pro-Isreal.  The Palestinian voices
  are never heard.  This isn't a "two-sided" issue as
  many liberal fence-straddlers would have you believe.
  Unless those sides are "our land was taken, and we've
  been put through hell" vs. "we took land and put
  others through hell."  This is not a case of Arab vs.
  Jew, cousin fighting cousin.  This is the ruled people
  vs. colonialists.  Palestine must be free.  Israel is
  no democracy.  We cannot stand for this land of the
  free for one people and land of misery for another.
  The US must stop supporting dictators and other
  undemocratic governments.  Democracy as in a state
  where people get a say in how they are ruled.  (Please don't give me your useless comments that Democracies do not exist, I am using a broader definition.)
  Power to the people.  Down with imperialism!
  <p>So I wrote a <a href="http://www.dailyillini.com/may01/may07/opinions/stories/letter02.shtml">letter</a> to the DI, attacking <a href="http://dailyillini.com/may01/may03/opinions/stories/letter04.shtml">Michael Frazin's points</a> and defending <a href="http://dailyillini.com/may01/may02/opinions/stories/letter03.shtml">what</a> sister Mariam had to say (Frazin actually twisted her words).</p>
