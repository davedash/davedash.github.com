Okay, so I finished the sleep study.

I get in at 8:30pm last night.  They hook up all these electrodes to me, and they expect me, a tosser and turner, to fall asleep with all these wires lightly restraining me.  I went to bed at 10, lights out at 11.

So I had a crappy sleep, woke up before 7, I woke up once or twice at night, once at 1am because I needed to be rewired.

When I woke up they told me I'd be there all day for a nap study.  Every two hours I was to see if I could nap.  They also took off half my wires.  I wrote code on sheets of paper between naps.  I think only two of my naps were successful.

Interesting experience to say the least.  I'll find out in 3 weeks what the assessment is.
