excerpt: Last week went back home (despite travel troubles).  I love hanging out with my friends in MN.  Just a great group of people.  Now with my new telephone which conveniently is in the 612 area code (local to Minneapolis) I can talk to them.  Or just wait a week until they road trip down to Chicagoland for the taste.
