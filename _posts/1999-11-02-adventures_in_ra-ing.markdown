title: Adventures in RA-ing
excerpt: |-
  So Angie finally finished this huge hideous project that she had for some class.  So yesterday after dinner and before hall council we were chillin' in her room.  I was talking to her about halloween stuff and then she came up with this idea.  Basically we took one of the pumpkins in her room and stuck a can opener (which looks more or less like a knife) with a note attatched that said "you."  We used barbecue sauce as blood and put it around the can opener.  So we had this bloody pumpkin.  We went around from room to room and knocked on peoples' doors and freaked them out.  Other people just didn't get it.
  <P>On that same note, I also turned in my application today for being an RA... funny that.
