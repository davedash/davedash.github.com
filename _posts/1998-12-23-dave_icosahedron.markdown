  Well I completely formatted my NT Server system at home and installed Debian Linux.  It's been quite an experience.  I've installed it perhaps three times, but each time I learned something new.  In all actuallity I didn't need to reinstall it so many times, it just seemed like a neat idea each time.  So now, I finally have my computer working and Netscape works too.
  <p>So here's what I like.  It loads fast.  It's very configurable.  There's a lot of software I can now download.  Software is a cinch to install thanks to apt-get and dselect.  What I dislike is the window environment (Window Maker).  Of course I'm going to be changing that after I send this message.  Several window managers have been created for X-Windows.  I also dislike Netscape.  It looks ugly when it renders forms and it crashes in certain places.  Plus, I never really liked it for windows.
  <p>Life has been pleasant since I got back.  Saturday night I was visited by Molly and my alter-ego, Katie.  Sunday I finally recieved my luggage.  I don't remember Monday.  Tuesday we visited Katie to see how she was.  Wednesday (today) we (Adam, Marc, Molly and I) made pancakes.  They were good.  We then went to the MSP airport and went to pick up Mike Jorgenson, whose flight was an hour late.  We proceded to UNOs pizzeria, and ate delicious pizza.  We then went back to my house to play Dr. Mario and pick up my gift for Katie and we then dropped it off.
  <p>Humourous things started happening afterwards.  There was a knock at Katie's door and Mike was the closest one to it, so he answered.  Lo and behold it was Mike's arch-enemy, Tanya Zhu.  They don't speak to each other which makes things very interesting seeing as they both have information that when exchanged could add to a decent conversation.  Anyway, I'll try to wrestle a picture featuring Tanya and Mike from Katie and post it.
  <p>We (reduced to Molly and I) decided at about 4:30 to drop off Mike Jorgenson since his parents were expecting him to be picked up at 10:16 and dropped off within a few hours, not at 4:30.  Well that's what we figured.  Then Molly and I came home and then she left and I went with my parent to eat at First Wok, a decent Chinese Restaurant.  I was going to go to Katie's but I felt tired, and I'd rather save up my energy and do stuff tomorrow.  Although tomorrow is X-mas eve.  I'll figure out something to do.
  <p>It's strange.  When I type my journal at school, I feel like I'm writing for my friends not at UIUC.  When I type my journal here, I feel like I'm typing it for my friends at UIUC.
