title: A question...
excerpt: |-
  I've complete the user modification scripts for davedash.com.  I have 
  one question: Should users be able to change their usernames?
  <P>
  Currently, you can.  I was reading through slashdocs and they mentioned that
  using the slash system you could not.  I was wondering if people
  see this as a hole where abuse can crop up? 
  <P>
  In general my theory is to make things as open and customizable as I 
  can, if they become a problem than shut them down.
  <P>
  Anyway, your comments would be appreciated.
  <P>I am working this week almost full-time.  But I do plan on getting... 
  a system written so I can modify any user.  I am very sorry if it 
  appears that this site is taking a long time.  Just to keep people 
  updated here's what needs to happen: this super-user modification 
  system that I will write this week needs to be coded.  A journal
  modification system needs to be coded as well as a journal viewing
  system.
  <P>I've roughly laid out the algorithms for these three things.  
  I want to get them online very soon.  After that I'll tweak everyhting
  and work on a new layout.
  <P>On a personal note, talk to me if you don't already.
