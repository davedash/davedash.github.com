  Marc is staying at my apartment now while he waits for me to finish my internship.  In the meantime he's cleaned up the kitchen and whatnot.  Wow...
  </p><p>
  This week is busy I guess.  I'm anxious because I have a mail-order for a decent amount that is constantly being delayed (They claim to have shipped it each time I call, but they lie).  Which means it will take forever to reach me since I'll need to do postal mail forwarding.  But I'd really just like to rollerblade now...
  </p><p>
  I heard some good news from Julie in that I don't have to go down to Urbana to put my stuff in my house since her Dad got a huge truck.  Saves Marc and I some time and means I get to be in Minnesota that much sooner.
  </p><p>
  That's all for now.  See you soon Minnesota and see you soon Urbana.  As for Palatine... so long.
