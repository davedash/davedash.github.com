title: New site...
excerpt: |-
  <a href="http://www.mattwright.com/">MattWright</a> has this to say 
  about iMacs, "iMac is the whore of computers.  It 'wears' all this 
  cheap 'clothing.'"
  <p>I have finished the HTML mockup of my new web site.  It looks 
  okay under Netscape for Linux, I think it will look better under 
  systems that have TrueType Fonts.  It took me a while since I had an 
  HTML tutorial opened while I was typing out the HTML, because I wanted 
  everything to be syntactically correct.  It also uses a ton of style 
  sheets (whereever it seemed right).  This makes it easier to make my entire site all look the same.
  This mockup is my goal to shoot 
  for.  Basically it looks just like my site will, except everything is
  static, rather than dynamic.  Here's what is left:
  <ul><li>Write a PHP script that generates 'generic' excerpts of HTML 
  on demand.  Basically this would be like a function that would display 
  a menu, the journal entries, the page title, etc.
  <li>Write a new journal interface that uses mySQL (rather than mSQL 
  which is far inferior and what I am using now).
  <li>Write a calendar interface (far simpler than the current 
  <a target=_self href="calendar.php3">calendar</a>).
  <li>Write a 'siteWatch' interface (you'll see).
  <li>etc..
  </ul>
  Of course, some steps will take longer than the others.  The journal 
  will take a while to get used to, just because there is so much 
  involved with writing it.
  <P>Also, I plan to add a message board where you can reply to all of 
  my posts and write whatever.  This is similar to slashdot's way of 
  doing stuff except that I will have a very throroughly coded message 
  board.  (I'll probably just write something that looks exactly like 
  Matt's unreleased <a href="http://www.wwwboard.com/">WWWBoard</a>).
  I think this part will take a while and may be something I work on 
  after the new site is up.  Of course, in theory, this shouldn't take 
  too long for me.
  <p>I'll also add a small survey system in time... you know... I'm pretty 
  much ganking stuff from slashdot, left and right.
