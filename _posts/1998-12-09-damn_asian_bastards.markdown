  Hey, I found out a new trick you can do on this website... well if you have IE 5 it works, it may work with IE 4 too.  Okay, in this journal page, I have not yet removed the large moon logo.  What you can do is go to the favorites menu (works if you have a lot of favorites in a lot of subdirectories) and just scroll down.  Everytime a menu opens the browser re-renders everything starting with the lowest layer.  In other words the moon will appear.
  
  <p>Once I dreamt of a city of gold (earlier today), and then I realized why it could not exist.  If portions of the city were gilded, people would start mining the city.  So the gold would have a negative effect, because people will be hasty when they mine the gold.  The gold will be a catalyst in ruining the city.  Similarly copper is quite valuable.  In China copper telephone lines were dug up and sold on the black market.  To rememdy this, China just advanced it's technology and started using fiber optics (Negroponte).  Technology makes things cheap.  So, I'm sure I could come up with something better than a city made of gold.  I could probably figure out some aesthetically pleasant design that doesn't have this yellowy sparkle that people all love to steal.  It will also be cheaper.  This will be the city of cheap technology.  It will be guarded by the Technobots.  With their gestalt technology they can merge and form the mighty Computron.  Computron will be the most powerful thinking machine in the world, and the mayor.
  <p>My roommate was a sexfiend.
  <p>Yesterday I ate at Subway.  I tried the Parmesan Chicken Wrap.  It's not that great.  Here's why.  Subway makes good sandwhiches.  Their employees aren't trained well to make wraps, since mine had a tear in it.  They make very good sandwhiches and they taste better than their wraps.  It was better than school food though.  School food today wasn't bad.  It was edible.
