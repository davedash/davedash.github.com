title: Networking squirrels...
excerpt: |-
  Today was nice when I went outside... I was really laid back.  I dropped 
  some film at Walgreens.  While waiting for the film to develop I stopped 
  by a poster store and saw really cool Star Wars posters... including 
  a Queen Amidala poster that was more elaborate than mine (most of the ones 
  the store carried were more elaborate than the collection I have).  
  Most posters had small problems that I didn't like.  The Queen's had 
  no Padme, which is okay since it should only be the decorated queen, but 
  it lacked the headdress for the queen that I like most (it's the one
  they have on the movie poster showing all the main characters, I'd give you 
  a link if I could)... it may have had it, but it wasn't the center picture.
  Anyway, there was another poster of Darth Maul, but it had a stupid 
  thing that said SithLord on it that made it look silly.  Then their were the
  posters for the good guys which had Jar Jar on it unfortunately (his 
  only good lies in the fact that his amphibious race could fight for a 
  few minutes against a droid invasion army).  Anyhow, there was also the 
  poster of bad guys which was okay too.  They were all about $10 each.  
  There was also really cool posters from the 80s or even 70s reprints of
  the original three movies. Very cool.  I wish I had the money.
  <P>
  The next place I stopped by was a record shoppe.  It had a rack of new 
  albums including a new Orbital album which I am determined to preview 
  somehow.  Moby also has a new album out and so does Chemical Brothers, 
  except Chemical Brothers will be out on the 22nd of June.  I looked at
  posters and t-shirts and a few albums there.  It was very nice.  I 
  must somehow acquire these albums... well at least the Orbital one... 
  I'll maybe stop by best buy some day... or ask my roommate, Jason, to
  check the price on it (since he works there).
  <P>I have two requests.  No more, no less.
  <OL>
  <LI>
  Okay a small request.  I need peoples opinions about this site.  
  What's good, what's bad, and especially why.  The only reason I ask 
  is so I can keep it in mind when I design other sites.
  <LI>
  While I am in Michigan this weekend, I won't be making too many major 
  updates on my new website which is in development.  Basically it's a 
  good time for people to play around on it and tell me what they think, 
  what they'd like to see, etc.  If you are willing to do this, email or 
  ICQ (preferred) me.  I'll give you the details later.
  </UL>
  Thank you.
