After much debate I decided to get the ReadyNAS NV+ with a single 500GB disk.  It's great so far. I even got [ssh to work](http://chapados.org/2007/5/6/readynas-shell-access-redux) which means I have [rsnapshot][r] working (I can post details if necessary).

The problem is... I wouldn't have needed [rsnapshot][r] at all if the CD they shipped me wasn't cracked.  I called Netgear (who is headquartered down the road, literally) and they said they can't do anything and that I should call Newegg (the vendor) or call EMC the provider of the backup software (and my next door neighbor at work).  Newegg could only give me a $25 credit which is fine, but as someone at my work pointed out... that's not the same as a 5 seat Mac/Windows license for a backup software.

Of course... it's impossible to hunt down an actual support email address for Netgear, so this might not get resolved.

FYI, Here's some [good links about readyNAS](http://del.icio.us/davedash/readynas) that I've found.
