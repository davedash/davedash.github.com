title: Fifth Element
excerpt: Here's an <a href="http://nicholas.www.media.mit.edu/people/nicholas/Wired/WIRED2-07.html">old article from Nicolas Negroponte</a>.  I think it is quite interesting.  It deals with learning and Legos.<p>This Friday I had a CSci Test and I actually finished it.  I was happy.  I also finished watching fifth element and learned that wind + fire + water + earth + perfect women = light.  Unfortunately, it's hard to get samples of some of those "elements."<p>Wired and all their web sites suck.  For some reason close tags and propperly functioning pages are of no concern to them.
