title: Arlington Road
excerpt: |-
  I saw Arling (yeah, I know... all I do during break is watch movies and TV)... I saw Arlington Road today (Tuesday).  That is a tremendous movie.  It kept my brother and I on the edge with a slight feeling of discomfort throughout most of the movie.  That discomfort I guess made it a good movie.
  <P>I've got this problem.  I have a CD carrier that carries 104 cds.  I have 120 odd cds that I'd like to take back to school.  I've got another case for CDs that I could use, I suppose.  I'm also looking at cutting and pasting tracks together to form new CDs.  There's got to be a better way to take music with you.
  <P>Here's my thing.  I'm not one for compressed music (come on, I'm not one for compressed anything, if I like it enough.  That's why I'm taking all my CDs).  So MiniDisc's and MP3s are out of the question.  What I'd like is for a forward thinking company that knows how to put a lot of 1s and 0s in a small area (IBM, I'm looking at you) to create mini-drives which can hold maybe a gigabyte of data.  It would include music data that was uncompressed.  Track titles and artist work, videos and whatever else artists included with their releases.  The artist would use a low volume version of these drives to distribute music, but you'd only carry the higher capacity mini-drives and include only the songs you wanted.  It would all be managed using some snazzy-Jetsonesque computer interface.  As far as copy protection goes, I guess that's a bit out of the picture.  Likewise I could care less.  I'll pay $20 per album, and I'm sure other music connoisseurs will too.  I mean it's not as if people aren't violating protections right now with CDs.  Everyone I know has burned CDs of music artists.  I don't.  I pay money for music I like.  MP3s I use for one-hit wonders or for music that I don't feel deserves my money, but deserves my ear.  That's just my philosophy on music.  We'll leave it to the bureaucracy of media distributors to decide.
