title: "Star Wars: Episode 1"
excerpt: |-
  My roommate mentioned that the Episode 1 book had a few things that 
  the movie left out.  I borrowed his book and read it within the span of 
  approximately 22 hours.  This is pretty good for me, seeing as usually it takes
  me a few days to go through 324 pages.
  <p>
  The book is much better than the movie.  It's nice because you can read
  it and visualize what was left out of the movie.  The Gungan were less 
  annoying as a whole.  There was a lot more dialogue, especially between members of the Jedi Council.  
  In fact, the Council finally at the end agreed to Anakin being trained, only Yoda said that he disagreed with the council.  
  It also had a lot more interaction between Anakin and Padme, and Anakin and Obi-Wan as well as more 
  R2D2 stuff.
  <p>What may make it worth while to many of you is the fact that the 
  <i>Duel of Fates</i> scene is a bit longer.  Also Darth Maul speaks a 
  lot more and more is revealed about his nature.
  <p>Overall I think the book is worth reading.  It gives you a lot better 
  of an understanding of what is happening.  Of what Qui-Gon's relationship to Obi-Wan is and how they both relate with the force.  There is also nice information on the Sith.
  It's a quick read if you've seen the movie, so go for it if you thought the movie was okay.
  <p>I don't remember when I last updated, but I'll say a few things.  
  While moving out of Allen Hall I came across a large ammount of pennies.  Hundreds of pennies... this will be very good when I add it to my collection.  
  The Saturday after I moved out, my ICQ list shrunk manifold.
  <P>The other day I came up with this cool idea.  Queen Amidala (or her handmaiden, Sabe) in the movie (and the book) had several different dresses.  I'm sure she has enough dresses to complete both sides of a chess board.  
  For the pawns they could use Padme.  Now when Padme reaches the end of the board, she can say "I am Queen Amidala."  This was just a random thought.
