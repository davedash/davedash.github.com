title: Silicon Implants
excerpt: |-
  I'm getting silicon implants.
  <P>I have what is known as congenital
  ptosis in my left eyelid.  Basically Ptosis is a drooping of the upper
  eyelid.
  <P>When I was four I had surgery which fixed a significant ammount of problems that I did have with my eyelids.  Around last year I felt that it was time to have more work done on my eye.
  <P>I met with the very doctor who worked on my eyes 15 years ago and we scheduled surgery.  The processis basically adding a silicon sling within my eye that will keep my eye open like normal.
  <P>The surgery will take place next Tuesday (3 Aug).
