title: Small town parades and American Pie
excerpt: |-
  We (some friends) went to the Hopkins Raspberry festival.  That was a lot of fun, even though the parade went on a little long.  After that we went to the Romportl's family get-together where we ate and babysat... it was fun.  Even Dan said so.  If Dan says it's fun, then it's fun.
  <P>Later this night we went to see <I>American Pie</I>, which was very amusing (although I for one liked <I>South Park</I> more).  Then we went to Perkins and later loitered around the theater's parking lot.
  <P>Well... this summer I've surprised myself... <I>Star Wars</I> and <I>Austin Powers</I> were not the only movies I saw at theaters.
