Usability for a limited audience... (for example a web app for one person, or a small team) is far far different than web usability for a public web site.  

In many ways it's easier.  You can think about it in terms of what would Joe, Bob, Sue or whoever is using the site would think.  Usually design constraints are normalized, like screen resolution.

It gets tricky though when your audience wants an interface that others might not consider usable.  For example, having an optimal resolution of 1920x1200 or having less readable labels for controls, because they are learnable (we'll touch on learn-ability soon).

Sometimes you got to bite the bullet and actually suppress what you know about designing an easy to use interface and understand the needs of just your audience.
