title: Count to ten...
excerpt: |-
  I haven't written for a while... I have stuff to write, just never get around to typing it.  Anyhow...
  <p>
  I've been reading through the news and I just wonder if any of the conflict would be resolved if people just put a little thought into their actions.  Count to ten before you act in anger.  Counting calms the mind.  You then start to think about what you do before it gets done.
  </p><p>
  If I had a gun, and didn't act with caution people would be falling left and right.  I'm trying to cross the road, if you are in a car and don't slow down for me, I might just shoot you.  This is my biggest annoyance, and it is the only time I would ever want a gun.  Of course, if I did have a gun, I wouldn't use it so recklessly.  I would count to ten before I acted in anger.  A clear mind prevents many a mistake.
  </p>
  <p>
  In all honesty, guns should be banned.  You bring a gun into a situation, and the fun is over.  There is no reversal of fortune, unless either I myself am armed or you are clumsy.  I don't think guns deter crime.  I think they are a tool of sacrilege.  They allow people to feel like they are God (or as close to God as they can get) and alter a persons life in a far too abrupt manor.
  </p>
  <p>Peace be upon you.</p>
