title: Hijacking
excerpt: |-
  A plane from Kathmandu to New Dehli has been hijacked and that led me to thinking.  I thought and I thought and I said, "Brain.  You're a good brain.  You are able to solve most problems I throw at you.  Solve the problem of hijacking."  My brain got to work and it came up with this idea.  Airplane staff should be trained in these types of situations.  Of course in a real hostage situation, no matter how much training someone goes through, they can always freeze.
  <P>So that's where beloved technology comes in.  The first idea I came up with was a remotely controlled gun.  That would be a on a rail on the ceiling and would fire down at someone.  Unfortunately it's not a good thing to use when in the air due to the chance of missing your target and depresurizing the cabin.  So my next idea was poisons or potions.  If they need something to drink the airhosts can serve them some concoction that will put them to sleep.  My final idea was to somehow gas the seating area of the plane with something that would put everybody to sleep.  If you could somehow prevent the gas from affecting the pilots then you are set.  Of course, it isn't too far from the future when planes will be fully automated.  I'm sure we have the technology to control planes remotely at least.  I'll find out more about this.
  <P>Merry Christmas to all who celebrate.  To those who don't take advantage of the commercial benefits of the season.
