excerpt: "Here's what we've been up to this week:<p>Molly and I are working at the <a href=\"http://math.umn.edu/itcep/\">IT Center for Educational Programs</a>.  We are TAing for the <a href=\"http://math.umn.edu/itcep/prime/summer.shtml\">PRIME summer program</a>.  This is by far the best job (between working for my Dad, and <a href=\"http://www.busdir.com/\">PNBD</a>) ever.  Although it is very frustrating being in charge of 18 sixth or seventh grade boys especially when the other TA, Molly, is dealing with seven docile girls.  It's been very fun anyway.  Tomorrow I hope it's hot, so I can swim.  Although T-storms have been forcasted.<p>I was supposed to help people at <a href=\"http://www.inres.com/\">Innovative Research</a> work on their web site, but they have no money.  So I will be doing far less web work this summer.  This is unfortunate, because I make a lot of money that way.  I did how ever recieve a payment from <a href=\"http://www.med-rx.com/\">Nutrition Dynamics</a>.<p>I've almost finished the Foundation Series.  I have one final book to complete: <i>Forward the Foundation</i>.  <a href=\"http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ywong/\">Yishan</a> says it is the best in the series.  After this book, I'll take a break from Sci-Fi and may delve into Tolkien, or Science."
