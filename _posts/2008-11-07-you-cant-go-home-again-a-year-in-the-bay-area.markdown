Yesterday as I left work it dawned on me that I had been in the San Francisco
Bay Area for a year.  It is one of the most drastic changes in my life since
going to college.

I remember announcing to my family that Katie and I were moving to the Bay Area
as I had accepted a job at Yahoo! working on one of my favorite web sites,
[Delicious][d].

The decision to move, the actual move itself, the settling in period, exploring
the area, meeting friends new and old... it was all an adventure.  The question
everyone asks is how's california... it's awesome... even after a year.

* We're a short distance  a Costco, Target, restaurants and the middle of a small town
* Reconnected with friends from High School, College, Minneapolis and met new friends...

* We can't go home again...


We've been to Minnesota three times, and each time it feels less and less like home.  The home I grew up in is alien, the house we own isn't our home.  Stores open, stores close.  Minneapolis has changed and we've changed.  It still holds a special place in our heart.
