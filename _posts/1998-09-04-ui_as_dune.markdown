title: UI as Dune
excerpt: |-
  After a week of classes and a couple weeks of living here, I've recognized that UI is actually Dune.  That's right.  I'm taking the ficition that I've been reading and applying it to the real world where it doesn't belong.<p>
  I was brought up in Minnesota, where you'd get the most unexpected weather.  It was generally cold.  I have grown accustomed to cold weather.  I long for cold weather to come.  During the summer in Minnesota it gets quite hot, so we retreat to our Air Conditioned hideaways.
  <p>Now my home for the greater part the year is Urbana, Illinois.  It's hot here.  Retreating to airconditioning is not an option.  It's deathly hot, but you get used to it.  When I moved here, I had to get acquainted with the fre(sh)man.  I had to become a fre(sh)man.  I have ridden the great busses which travel at great speeds.  But I prefer walking.  The real comparison is that Urbana is a training ground for me.  I am to be educated here, but I don't think the classes will be the only thing that shape me here.  I think the environment will force me to be more adapted to different places.<p>
  You start to learn things.  You are forced to be organized.  You are forced to explore.  When I walk from Allen Hall to the Quad, I take a short cut, or sometimes it's a long-cut through another building that is Air Conditioned.  I learn lots of silly things here.<p>I don't know why I'm going off on such a strange tangent.  I got a new desk from the Residence Halls.  This one allows me to put my large computer monitor on the desk and my tower case without wasting too much space.
  <p>All of the above was pre-written yesterday.  Today I got speakers from my neighbor and they are large.  I don't know if I like them.  I got my new telephone.  I think there's a link in a previous entry to it.  I love it already.  I should run a wire to a friend's room and thus have a second phone line.<p>Hey, thanks to silly American holidays like Labor Day, I have no roommate this weekend!  My parents are coming to visit.  It would mean something if I missed them, well wait it does mean something.  I guess I do miss them, but I'm just not realizing it.  Hopefully I'll have fun with them.<p>
  Email is great.  I think it strengthens my friendships.  I ramble so I'll be quiet.
