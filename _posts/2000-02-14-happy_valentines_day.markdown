title: Happy Valentines Day
excerpt: |-
  I guess wearing black is associated with depression on Valentine's day.  I disagree.  I wore black because black clothes are cool.
  <P>
  Anyway.  I'm balancing three jobs and 18 credit hours and training for aquahood as well.  It's not too bad.  I just need to push.
  <P>So anyway.  I hope all you single people out there aren't on a depression streak, because there is so much more to life than being depressed.  For all you coupled people I hope this day is a good one.
  <P>It is now time for the master to sleep.
