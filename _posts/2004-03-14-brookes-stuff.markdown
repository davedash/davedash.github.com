So Brooke, my downstair's neighbor, has a new bike that costs more than Katie's Tercel and my Prizm combined.  Yipes.

I was helping her store stuff in the basement and she was going to take one of her TVs down as well, but I asked if we could keep it while she lives here.  So now we have a slightly larger TV that will remain unwatched ;)  But I'm sure I can actually use it to watch DVDs once my laptop comes back from repairs.  This'll surprise Katie ;)
