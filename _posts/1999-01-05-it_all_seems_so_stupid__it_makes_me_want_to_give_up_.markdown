title: It all seems so stupid. It makes me want to give up.
excerpt: |-
  I woke up early today... you know... like when I should wake up... before 6AM.  I love this.  Most of my friends are going to sleep right now... well except for those going to school.  I can listen to the good old KQ Morning show.
  
  <p>Odd, I was planning on seeing Mr. Janos get sworn in as governor of Minnesota, but that was yesterday.  So Minnesota... now for something completely different.
  
  <p>I am a Sunkist addict.  Every morning, despite better judgement ... I grab a can of Sunkist and guzzle it down.  I try not to drink any other pop...  Perhaps I will be joining Adam and SMatt and become diabetic... you know... God playing a joke on me... "Ah, so he thinks he can drink Sunkist instead of Orange Juice for breakfast?  Well, I'll give him diabetes."  My grandfather (aja) has diabetes.  He likes Citra.  Because in India Citra is sugar free.
  
  <p>Windows need redesigning... they should form complete seals when shut.  Thus cutting down on heating bills.
  
  <p>I had this dream where someone made Macaroni and Cheese (the tube macaroni) and it tasted good.  The other dream was where Mike Jorgenson, my friend who attends UPenn and the Wharton School of Business, was actually stupid.  The reason he got anywhere in life was because he could fake being smart very well.  But I found out his secret...  That dream was "dope."  All my dreams are "dope."  Like they are just these really whacked what-if situations.  Like what if the sky was made out of Crystal Meth.  Or if I had three apples and I gave you two apples, I'd have five apples.  That'd be "dope."  I'd give apples out left and right, and come out ahead.
  
  <p>Oh yeah, I did not watch Ally McBeal.  I'm not that bored.
  
  <p>Back to dreams.  I decided realistically a house that I'd want to have in the future would be this house.  Just because it's needed so much maintenance, and I feel I could do a better job than my parents, namely because I know stuff.  I'd have fun making this house like decent.  Don't get me wrong it's a nice house, but there's little things that could be made better.  I'd also get better windows.  I'd get windows that collect solar energy.  Windows that were tinted so you couldn't see inside the house.  That would be dope.  I'd also get stuff that would reroute natural light via a strategic network of fiber optic cables.  That would make this house so "dope."  Then I'd redo a few rooms so they made more sense.  I'd also redo the landscaping.  Sure you're wondering how I'm going to afford this, but the way I see it is if I can afford a house, I can afford to like make changes to it.  I'd also change the doorbell so it would play a few bars of Mario when someone rings the doorbell.
  
  <p>Ugh, I can't stand my home anymore.  I mean there's nothing here that is pleasing.  I like the fact that I have some space and some privacy, but that doesn't do it really.  I mean my parents seem to treat me the same way as they have always treated me - like a little kid in a candy store that's closed and all the candy is locked.  What the hell is wrong with me... I've got like a barrel full of metaphores and similes.
  
  <p>Yes, by the way.  I am still home.
