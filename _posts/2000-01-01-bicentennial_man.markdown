title: Bicentennial Man
excerpt: |-
  Welcome to the world of tomorrow.  Welcome to the Y2K.  How cheesy is that?  Well anyway, I rang in the "millenium" with a small group of good friends.  I enjoyed that immensely.  It's a far cry from my childhood visions of wanting to see the year 2000 rung in from Times Square.  Of course, I think I may have actually wanted to see 2001 rung in from Times Square, being the "true" millenium (thanks to the illogical way we count).  Anyway, I did enjoy it none the less.  They also showed Batman Beyond last night, so I was more than pleased.
  <P>I saw <I>Bicentennial Man</I>.  I enjoyed that movie.  I suppose it may be a bit sappy for some, but it was a good movie.  Typical of Asimov's lighter stories and of Robin Williams' movies.
