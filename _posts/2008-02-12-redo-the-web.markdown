Sometimes it's nice to read a blog the "normal" way.  You go to the site and just read the entries in reverse chronological order ... versus the RSS-crazy aggregated with everything else.

François Zaninotto's [Redo The Web][r] is a great blog for that if you do any work with [symfony][] or web development in general.  François wrote most of the documentation for symfony including *The Definitive Guide to Symfony* and his blog manages to keep that same easy-to-follow tips and tutorials.

Definitely check it out.
