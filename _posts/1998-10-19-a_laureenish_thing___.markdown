title: A Laureenish thing...
excerpt: "I went to a GLBT issues thing at Allen Hall (which cleverly hid under the facade of a sex discussion with free pizza).  Obviously the pizza lured me in, as I don't have time to do anything.  It was actually interesting to listen to the people with their voices.  GLBTphobia is one of those things that I don't like dealing with because it's one of the flaws of society along with racism and other types of prejudice.  It makes me think, \"Gee humanity, you can't accept gays?  What's wrong with you, we need to make the future now.  Nobody cares whether your gay in the future.\"  That's just me.  I think humanity needs to advance out of these pidly issues.  Stop being homophobic and racist.  It's just pointless at the root level.  People mentioned that most of this homophobia comes out of fear.  At least that is what the speaker said.  I was too shy to actually argue with her and say that it's not fear all the time.  It may be fear for a lot of the people.  It was fear for me when I was younger and didn't really think about homosexuality.  For the people who act out, its not necessarily fear, but personality.  Humans love to point out the flaws in others.  They love making themselves look perfect and the others look flawed.  For example: <i>We hate blacks.  We don't fear them.  We just hate them.  They are different, and we are not them.  Thus we are better.</i>  There maybe an underlying fear at the rootlevel now that I think about it.  Why else would people undermine others?  If we undermine others in efforts to bring some change in others, that is one thing.  If we undermine others just for the sake of undermining... well we don't achieve anything, but maybe we feel a little better?  But why?  Why weren't we feeling better leaving these groups alone?  We fear them because we don't understand them?  We're not used to it?  Maybe.<p>I admittedly undermine people all the time.  Sometimes it's a joke, sometimes seriously.  I don't do this when I'm serious by using a group of some sort as the basis for undermining people.  It's usually something they've done.  It, however, is the wrong way to go about solving a problem.  People get resentful when you make them feel like less of a person.  I try to stop.  Maybe one day I'll succeed.<p>Then again there's Jack.  I'll upload an MP3 to the MP3 server.  It's very Jorgenson like.  Details will be posted later.  (If you do not know what MP3 server to which I refer, you can ask me.  I don't want to publicize details.)"
