title: Waiting for Guffman
excerpt: Hey, I saw <i>Waiting for Guffman</i> this Friday with Marc &c.  It was very strange.  Not as strange as <i>True Stories</i> though.  It featured the six-fingered man from the Princess Bride.<p>So far Kay and Laureen are my site-pickers.  I need 3 more poeple (and I can only think of three other people who visit the site, so it works nicely).<p>For the next few days I'm going to be working on this wacky "thing" at my temple's site.  Hmm... it should be good.  It's basically a better email list which I will combine with the message board too.<p>Oh, and Michael Jorgenson.  The camel is safe.  Kameru wa daizyobu desu.
