I get bored with mundane tasks.  So I create little adventures for myself.  I had to create a list of countries and country codes to use on the [Firefox mobile home page](http://mozilla.com/mobile).  The first few lists were incomplete, so I made my own by parsing a list provided by the International Telecommunication Union.  I stripped it down to simple forms of the country names and removed codes that are very rare (satellite phones).

Well this could be a boring task for most people, so I placed it on [github][http://github.com/davedash/International-Dialing-Codes/].  Feel free to use this in your own projects, I even include a perl one-liner in the README to convert this into a drop down HTML list.
