title: They Might Be Giants over Urbana
excerpt: |
  To sum it up, the concert ruled.  I walked to <a href="http://www.ubl.com/cgi/search.tour.cgi?TYPE=venue&SEARCH=Foellinger+Auditorium">Foellinger Auditorium</a> with a group of Allen Hall residents who were going as well at about 7:30.  I didn't buy anything, so I sat down.  Third row from the stage on the right (facing stage).  It was too near the speaker, but my ears acclimated to the loud sound during the opening act, <a href=http://www.ubl.com/ubl/cards/080/5/03.html">Michael Shelley</a>.  He and the band he had was okay.  It's that alternative filler music you hear on the radio.  He was funny so that was nice.<p>
  <a href="http://www.tmbg.com/">They Might Be Giants</a> finally came on stage at about 9:15 PM.  They played Dr. Worm, New York City, Particle Man (with Kumbaya towards the end), Mammal, She's Actual Size, Twisting, <a href="/embed/thefamouspolka.mid">"The Famous Polka"</a> played once at normal speed, then sped up, Battle for the Planet of the Apes (I was a person, and yes... People did win), Spy, some song that I don't know the name of (one of the lines was "hey mister please play a song with the jingle jangle"), Lie Still Little Bottle, Birdhouse in Your Soul, The Guitar and the Conga.  I followed the Conga, but didn't really Conga.  The problem was, is when I tried to get back to my seat, I couldn't because the people in charge were telling everyone to go to their real seats, unfortunately mine was a third row seat.  I managed to get back, they played Ana Ng and Pet Name while I struggled.  They followed that with Spiraling Shape, Shoehorn with Teeth (which is neat live), She's an Angel (everybody loved this, but does everybody know my Angelic friend?).  They shot confetti out of a cannon for James K. Polk.  This was about the time I was thinking that the next song would be Why Does the Sun Shine and it would be the last.  Well it was, kinda.  We demanded encore (like in every concert) and they came back (like in every concert) to do two more songs, Istanbul and Dr. Worm again (with a little bit of "The Boys are Back in Town" thrown in).<p>
  The show was great, and I suggest all of you to see it.  Here are tourdates for places where I know people:<p>
