title: I am home
excerpt: I am at home.  I miss the Allen Hall entities already.<p>My trip back wasn't that great.  After Eric dropped me off I checked in my luggage.  My plane was ten minutes late at least.  I noticed a friend, Shiela, on the plane, but made no contact.  We touched down and got off the plane at about 4:30 in DTW.  I ran to my gate D4 for my 4:40 flight from the G concourse.  It was maybe 4:37, and I found that the gate changed to E12.  I missed the flight.  I found Shiela missed it too and we ended up taking a 6:40 flight to Minneapolis, which was also very late at arriving.  We got there almost a half an hour late.  I had trouble with the luggage.  I waited almost an hour and then found out that my luggage never left Champaign (thank you very much Mesaba/Northwest).  It finally arrived a few hours ago, but it would have been nice to not waste that hour.  So I'm home.  I'll try to post more entries lest I incur the wrath of Caroline.
