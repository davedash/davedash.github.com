title: The Wire

  <table align="left" width=142><tr><td><img border=1 src="http://www.ftmax.com/pics/981110-gumbywinter.jpg" height="214" width="142"></td></tr><tr><td><font size=1 face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>&quot;There is a fine, cocaine-like powder covering the grass outside my suburban home.  And I'm ever so pleased about it.&quot;</b></font></td></tr></table>
  I've recently been reading news directly from the "Wire."  I remember learning about how the news over the "Wire" looks in my technology education class.  Basically it tends to be in all caps, but not always.  Anything that isn't a common word is spelled in parenthesis as it sounds and a few other things that make it easy for radio announcers to read on the radio without messing up.  The thing that through me off guard was a UPI article which at the end had an email address: "emkay(at)msn.com."  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a> does this often, since a lot of their articles are directly from AP or UPI.
  <p>I was going to make some joke about Jesse "the Body" as our Governor and Andre the Giant being this genius with rhymes... but, umm... hmm... Kay <a href="http://www.users.uswest.net/~hegoin/home2.htm">did it</a>.  Except, I think she's serious.
  <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/triham/">CJ</a> noted that I do not have many links or personal information.  So I have a plan.  I'll remove the humor section and integrate it with a links section.  I'll also make the abstract include more personal information.  After Thanksgiving, I plan to scan all the pictures I have at home and add a tiny picture gallery.  Sound good?
