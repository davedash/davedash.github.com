  I keep forgetting to post stuff, despite my gobs of free time.  Yesterday we had a canoe expedition around the northern half of the Chain of Lakes.  It was quite fun.  Afterwards we had a picnic and then Adam, Julie, Molly and I saw <I>Drop Dead Gorgeous</i> an amusing film set in Minnesota.
  <P>Surgery tomorrow.  People who are relatively nearby can visit me in the afternoon or night.
