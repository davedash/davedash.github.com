  12 June    Style guides
  13 June    web usability

  16 July    Rewrite RSG in PHP3 (with help from Nada)
  17 July    RSG Information page
  18 July    Links page and add-a-ma-tron.
  19 July    Survey Script (with help from Jason Waye)
  20 July    Education site....
  21 July    Add people to friends page
  22 July    Scan pictures
  23 July    Window closing script (I need help on this).
