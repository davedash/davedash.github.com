title: No, I did not pull an all-nighter.  I actually wake up this early.
excerpt: |
  Eric's Treasure Trove of Mathematics (CRC Treasure Trove) which deserves no hyperlinking now only features entries that begin with 10 randomly selected letters (selected daily).  It's quite annoying, but understandable as it is a ploy to sell his book through the CRC press.  Unfortunately it makes the Internet a cheap substitute for reality.
  <p>
  I've been spending hideous ammounts of money and I have no job to compensate.  The money is spent on random things like food and other things.  So this week I'll begin my job and good things will occur.  Luckily, my friend, the "Coupon Bitch," who spends a lot of money, mostly on food, has not had her bad habbits rub off on me, yet.
  <p>Mike and I were talking about the future.  I mentioned how living in Allen makes me want to always live in an apartment or condo.  All your friends could be a door or two away from you and whatnot.  Eventually we got to thinking about how wierd it would be if Mike, Fred (Eric), Neal, Caroline and I all lived on the same street.  It would be like Mr. Roger's neighborhood (Fred would be Mr. Rogers).  We ended up deciding on something else as a realistic goal.  We'd buy large cabins.  We thought one in Florida or California or someplace coastal would be cool and one somewhere out in the middle of the woods.  I'm all for that, and am very determined to bring this dream a reality.  With the shared cabins we could all bring our families and party together at the beach or in the middle of the woods.  The future is cool.
  <p>Pakistan and India have finally met.  They both vow to resolve disputes.  This is nice.  It's too disturbing though that because of these talks there have been many protests on both sides by radicals.  In disputed Kashmir there has been several deaths too.

  <p>Jack got a joy stick the other day.  It's as large as his PSX.  It's kinda neat, but it's loud when he plays it.  I am getting better at collecting my things and just leaving the room, but it isn't nearly as bad as last semester when he'd never study.
  <p>I didn't solve a problem in time and failed to obtain a triple for next year for Mike, Neal and I.  So next year I'll be living across the hall in room 455 and my phone number will be one less, I believe (It's 3-DADDY-0 now).  I'll be rooming with Mike.  Neal will live in the same place 2 doors away with a friend of his.
  <p>I saw <i>Waterboy</i> at the <a href="http://www.union.uiuc.edu/">Illini Union</a> with Juj.  It's a pretty funny movie and well worth it for $2.  They also played <i>Block Rockin Beats</i> from the Chemical Brothers as well as <i>Tom Sawyer</i> from Rush.  They had the sound messed up in the movie though with Tom Sawyer.  You could barely tell the music was there.  I wish IUB would show movies as often as Molly's school does.
  <p>So today I got to sleep late :(  Jack and Josh's fault really.  I however was also awakened in the morning.  I heard some whispering and I was like... great Jack is talking in his sleep again.  Not so, I found out that he's whispering along to his CDs.  I finally got back to sleep, and when I woke up at the usual 6:30, I noticed Jack tossing and turning and muttering in Chinese.  freak.
