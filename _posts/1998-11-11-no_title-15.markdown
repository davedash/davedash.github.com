  <p>Thanks to Tuesday morning's wind dynamics that I don't quite understand in Allen Hall the doors here keep making noises, as if someone were pushing and pulling on them.  I think I fixed it in my room by applying poster tack.
  
  <p>For those of you who want ICQ 99a, you can get it <a href="http://hotfiles.zdnet.com/cgi-bin/texis/swlib/hotfiles/info.html?fcode=000DNE&b=">here</a> at least temporarily.
  
  <p>Umm... looks like I fixed the biggify button on the left.  There is now a "debiggify."  I finally found the phrase that I was missing from my Javascript at <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">cnn.com</a>.  Speaking of CNN.  CNN's custom news sucks, it gives you less information.  I found more things that interest me on the regular cnn page.
  
  <p>Download this <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stonline/html/metafiles/smokefree.ram">Ventura clip</a>.  A singing, rocking and rolling governor...
  
  <p>Not much is happening.  This week I am a good chemist and no the entire weeks worth of chemistry.  Unfortunately that doesn't help me with my pending assignments.  Damn!  I have math homework... and math class!
  
  <p>I started to work on this stupid, useless project of the Hindu Mandir registry/address book type thing (again).  I doubt anybody will make propper use of it, I'll see.  If I do anything tonight it will be a new project for <a href="http://www.medrx.com/">Med Rx</a> using <a href="http://130.126.72.54/medrx/new/">this</a>.
