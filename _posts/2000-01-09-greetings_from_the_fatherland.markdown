title: Greetings from the Fatherland
excerpt: |-
  It's about 12:36 PM in Germany now.  I came in last night and so far I love this country.
  <P>Our six hour stay in the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport was a bit uneventful.  I think in the next few years I'll make a point of actually visiting the Netherlands fully.  However, the airport itself is a great place.  Ryan Hayle will be happy to know that my favorite restaurant in Amsterdam is Sbarros (so far).
  <P>Germany is really cool and I haven't seen anything yet.  I'm staying with my uncle and his family at the Ramstein AFB.  He's got a nice place.  Right now I'm using his computer at the Landstuhl Regionel Medical Center (Army).
  <P>One of the most fascinating things I've seen have been the doors and windows.  They are all office style in his house.  His house is a slightly Americanized version of German living quarters.  The doors and windowshave three-states.  Open, closed and vent.  it seals the door very well too.
  <P>We plan on visiting several places.  We are nearby Stuttgard where there are Auto Museums for BMW and Mercedes.  We'll also take a trip to Paris, France.  We'll go to the Castles along the Rhine (which are nearby).  We'll also go to Berlin.  I'll try to keep you all updated.
  <P>I also have the "Well Traveled Camels."  I've done half my share with bringing them to Germany.  Now I must take pictures of stuff with them... ugh.  What sillyness.
