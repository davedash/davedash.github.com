title: Day 1, No Molly
excerpt: |-
  Well she's gone.  She left yesterday, early in the morning.  I won't see her ever again until mayhaps September.  I think I'll be okay though.<p>
  Monday I decided to go over to her house in the evening.  Yesterday -  Day 1 of no Molly went okay.  I got a lot of things finished.  I finished most of the remaining thank you cards (I have a few more from people who have sent me stuff but gave no card).  I also did <a href="http://www.laundry.com/">laundry</a> for the first time by myself.  It was easy.  (Thank god for the Internet.)<p>
  I also ordered a very expensive hard drive.  If any of you care it's an Ultra Wide SCSI (the only thing better is Ultra 2 Wide) 9.1 GB Seagate Barracuda.  I have no real idea on how to install a second SCSI drive, but I assume it's quite simple.<p>Today I will finish the thank you cards and send them out and later I will attend <a href="http://www.borchert.com/tom/">some kid's</a> birthday party.
