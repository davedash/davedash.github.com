title: Quake II in 3D
excerpt: |-
  Well today for work I got to visit the famous Virtual Cave from NCSA.
  
  I also played my first game of Quake II.  I played it in 3D, it was 
  awesome.  It's actually a hack called <a href='http://hoback.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~prajlich/caveQuake/'>Cave Quake II</A>.
  
  The technology was too amazing!  I looked at other stuff as well.  Very fun.
