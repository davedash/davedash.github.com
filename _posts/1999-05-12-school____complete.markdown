title: School... complete
excerpt: |
  I'm finsihed with my first year at the University of Illinois.  My finals 
  seemed to go well.  The classes this semester seemed very nice as well.  
  Hopefully my transcript says the same thing:)  It's sad down here.  
  Everybody's moving away one day at a time.  Soon I'll move to my 
  subleased apartment near <a href="http://www.beckman.uiuc.edu/">the Beckman</a>
  and will be away from all my friends.
  <p>I don't know if I mentioned this, but I am continuing my work for 
  Chickscope and doing some stuff for a few other companies over the 
  summer.  I will be returning to Minnesota around the end of June.  
  Among the things on which I will be working is my web site.  Lem 
  found the web site upon which this was based: <a href="http://www.glassdog.com/">glassdog</a>.
  The site is moving along at a steady pace.  Its design has been very 
  organized, although the code could be made cleaner.  I am, however, 
  more concerned with having it created first and leave it partially a
  mess.  I can go back and clean stuff up later (that's what I said last
  year).
  <p>Here's a quote from <a href="http://women.com/">women.com</a> from 
  Natalie Portman which makes her fit to be the Queen of Naboo, "Some of my roles have been a bit dark and rebellious,
  but I'd rather do that than make a kids' movie.  I'd do one if it 
  was realistic and not stupid, but I don'think many today are."
  <p>More <a href="http://www7.big.or.jp/~katsurao/fp/f-inax.htm">iMac stuff</a>.
  <p>Visit <a href="dougshaw.com">dougshaw.com</a>.  Doug is now added onto
  the list of "friends with domains."
