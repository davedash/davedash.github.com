title: Republicans have good ideas too.
excerpt: |-
  <a href="http://cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/10/14/budget.03/">Read this</a>.  I am going to have to side with the "evil" Republicans on this one.  School districts should be allowed to put money where they want it.  Local schools cater to different people with different demands.  They also are paying specific focus to special education... oh crap.  Special education usually means the mentally retarded not the gifted.  Well who knows, they might mean gifted.<p>
  <a href="http://customnews.cnn.com/cnews/pna.show_story?p_art_id=3040484&p_section_name=&p_art_type=763693&p_subcat=Development&p_category=Internet">This</a> is a mistake.
