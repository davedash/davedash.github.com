I had the pleasure of seeing my cousin whom I haven't seen in six or seven years and her family.  I also got to see Suzy's sister, Stephanie.

This conference was originally scheduled to occur in October, but was delayed due to the September 11th tragedies in NY and DC.  Despite it being late in the year, 300-400 people managed to show up.  Five of us from our collective at UIUC and I met a person from the U of M who said eight people were representing.

I think coordination is going to help a lot of these movements in other schools which have just not had the receptive atmosphere that Berkeley harbors.

Unfortunately Politics isn't my game.  I've taken so much ibuprophen to combat headaches onset by colds and strung out debating and deliberation.  I wish we had more time than just a weekend.

Anyway - I'm off to study during my break time.
