title: Day 22!!! :( No Molly (Tuesday)
excerpt: "Well today my cousin and her family left.  Today I had a fun day.  Katie, Marc and I and later Daniel watched <i>Freakazoid!</i>  We later made some food out of all the things we could find.  Then we went to Marc's where I read and they watched British TV.  Well I ended up watching some TV.  Katie was saddened that it would be the last day that she'll see me for a while.  For some reason I can't express the sadness as she does.  Perhaps it's because I am reading the <i>Dune</i> series.  The time for being sad about leaving is not now.  I should enjoy leaving in order to start off on the right foot when I go to college.  Perhaps I just adapt in order to survive.  I make light of leaving everyone by telling them that I may never see them again (which is improbable) or that the next time I see them will be far from now.  For now, I just wonder: What would a McKatie sandwhich be?  What would it look like?  What would it taste like?  Well overall, today was a good day.  Tomorrow my mother arrives from India."
