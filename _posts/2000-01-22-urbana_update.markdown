title: Urbana update
excerpt: |-
  I've been in Urbana since Monday in case people didn't gather.  It's great to be back at school except that the weather here is crap.  I've been adjusting to classes and doing a lot of cool organization stuff.  Let me explain in the next paragraphs, located directly below this sentences.
  <P>
  Earlier in the school year I was wondering what I'd do for living next Fall (and the rest of the year for that matter).  For a few months I was on an RA kick.  Long enough to actually go to one of the group RA candidate meetings and everything.  I needed a backup plan in case I couldn't be an RA.  Eventually I got talking to Mr. Roboto (a.k.a. Adam Nagao).  So we started looking for a place together.
  <P>After Thanksgiving break I decided no against becomming an RA completely.  For some time Adam and I were looking for a place with someone named Kate.  Eventually she opted to live with her current roommate elsewhere.  So, Adam and I teamed up with a group of two to look at one specific apartment.  We later decided against it.  Out of this group we retained John.  Now a good friend of mine, Julie, was also looking for a place and mentioned that she'd be "cool" living with us.  We kept that option open.  Winter Break came by fast and we could find no more a place to live.  We'd have to wait until January.
  <P>Through email Adam and I stated that we'd make a good effort to get a place as soon as we get back to Urbana.  When Adam waited four hours at Midway to pick me up and then we drove for a couple hours to Urbana we decided that if we did not find a place by Valentine's Day (not for it being Valentine's Day, but rather for it being just short of a month) we would commit <I>harakiri</I> since Adam was half Japanese and it seemed like damn good motivation if anything.
  <P>This motivation came about approximately Monday.  We declared our intentions to live with Julie.  Julie immediately agreed.  The rest of this was amazing clockwork.  Adam and I perused the classifieds section of the <a href='http://www.illinimedia.com/di/'> Daily Illini</A> and found a few places and marked them down.  We came up with several living combinations with Julie just so we could be flexible (5 or more bedrooms for the most part).  Tuesday Julie called and made an appointment at this "8 bedroom" house nearby.
  <P>Tuesday night Adam and I decided that we should go beat the crap out of each other.  We found the aforementioned "Kate" who was into kickboxing and decided to go to IMPE.  Unfortunately everybody was on a "get-in-shape" kick and we had no luck.  We did however find out that her roommate wants to stay in the dorms still.  We then adopted Kate and wooed her with stories of this magnificent 8 bedroom house we heard about.  We drove by it later that night and thought it was pretty cool (and that it was blue, not green).
  <P>Unfortunately I, nor Kate, nor Ellen could make it to the house appointment.  So it just clicked to me and I said, "let's have Jon tape the place using Ellen's camcorder."  Adam replied, "Jinkies, that sounds like a great idea."  Wednesday it ended up that Adam, Jon, Julie, Ellen and Susan (a new addition to our new posse) went.  They went they saw and they liked it with only a few minor complains.
  <P>I watched the video several times and Kate saw it as well.  I was go and thankfully so was Michelle.  The company had mentioned a group would be out there the next day for their second visit.  We had to act fast.  Wednesday night we all signed applications.  Thursday Ellen, Susan and I dropped them of at the company's office.  Thursday late afternoon Julie made an appointment for five of us to sign the lease.  Later we planned for Kate and Julie to go with Adam to finish signing the lease.
  <P>In essence what Adam and I had planned to take a few weeks was done in a matter of days very quickly and efficiently.  This is why we are classified as robots.<P>
  We plan to get another person to live with us to help lower our rent cost.  There are actually several more rooms available for occupancy, but due to the sheer volume of people we are opting against going over 9 people.
  <P>So to all my friends, including those from distant lands, you are all invited beginning next fall.
