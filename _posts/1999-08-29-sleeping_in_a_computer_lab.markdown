title: Sleeping in a computer lab
excerpt: |-
  So today I tried sleeping in a Allen's computer lab since it's insufferably warm in any non-airconditioned space.  I failed.  There was a mob of people goofing around on Yahoo chat, the lights were too bright and the floor was uncomfortable.
  <P>
  Chat rooms crack me up.  People spend hours and hours in them trying to 'meet' 'people.'  Then there's cybersex.  Listen to <I>Love Line</I> with Dr. Drew if you want to know about that.  Then there's the people who think they've formed some type of relationship.  It's a bunch of fantasy mixed in with reality.  Then again, this could be just me being closed minded.  I mean, maybe this is the next level of dating.  Like how email replaces postal mail.  Cyberdating via chat rooms replaces person-person contact.
