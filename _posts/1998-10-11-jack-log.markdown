  I thought it'd be fun to document Jack's life.  Jack for those of you who don't know is my roommate.  Here is what he did last night:<pre>
   8:44 PM: Jack has been playing a football video game
            for at least a few hours.
   9:51 PM: Jack finishes video game.  Jack is watching 
            some sports show, probably on  ESPN.  Surfing 
            channels occasionally.
   9:54 PM: Jack's work out: He lifts the TV onto my bed 
            so he can see it better.  (Will return it 
            back in an hour, he says).
   9:54 PM: Jack leaves the room.
   9:55 PM: Jack returns.
   9:56 PM: Flipping channels on his TV.  Watching some 
            football thing.
   9:59 PM: Also reading some ESPN book.  Watching 
            SportsCenter on ESPN.
  10:51 PM: Jack hears a noise and looks outside.  
            Perhaps wanting to see what it is.  TV is 
            left on, meaning he probably will re enter 
            the room.
  10:53 PM: Jack returns... leaves door open.  Inquires 
            about my waveform generations (pink noise 
            synchronized with alpha/theta waves 
            synchronized with alpha waves).
  10:59 PM: Minimize this window and keep it so when 
            people are in the room.
  11:01 PM: Jack leaves the room.  TV still on.
  11:03 PM: Jack returns.  Closes door slightly.  I like 
            that, because the outside noises add to my 
            mental interference.
  11:04 PM: Jack puts in a video game in his PlayStation 
            and starts playing.  I think it's in the 
            Street Fighter genre.
  12:24 AM: Stops playing Street Fighter.  Completes 
            workout by putting TV back in it's place.  
            30 minutes behind schedule.
  12:25 AM: Jack leaves the room.
  12:27 AM: Returns puts on shoes.
  12:29 AM: Leaves again, possibly for a smokey-smokey.
  </pre>
  Oh yeah, <a href="http://litestep.net/">Litestep</a> is cool.  Makes Windows NT look neat.  Only problem is in NT it disables my Windows Key shortcuts, however it doesn't in Windows 95/98.
