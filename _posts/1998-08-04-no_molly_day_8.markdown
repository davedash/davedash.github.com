title: No Molly Day 8
excerpt: |-
  It's been an entire week.  It's frustrating - making a meal for one.  I had Macaroni and Cheese from <a href="http://www.annies.com/">Annie's</a>.  It was very very good.  To make it required boiling.  Molly's the one who boils stuff.<p>
  I went to Best Buy with Marc and looked at a notebook with his friend.  She doesn't know much about computers and wanted to get other things as well, like a scanner.  After Best Buy Marc and I went to Paul Loudon's for a bit.  Then we went by Katie's, but Katie wasn't there.<p>The mail came late today.  When I got it though, I was very happy.  I got a letter from a friend of mine who is canoeing in Canada.  I call her Molly (among other things... you know, like "dear" and "loved one" or "chosen companion").  I read it and I was happy.  Included was Katie-bait (a letter for Katie).  I even have an address where I can send her mail.  I intend to write something.<p>
  Katie fell for the bait and showed up as Marc and I made pasta and tater tots.  Katie checked her email while Marc and I ate  and watched the Simpsons.  Then the three of us watched <i>Freakazoid!</i>.  It is a damn funny cartoon that is forever lost in syndication.  It's on the Cartoon Network at 6PM CDT on weekdays.
