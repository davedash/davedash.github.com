title: U of I Reception
excerpt: |
  So I went to this reception for accepted students for the U of I.  It was funny.  Everyone except three people were Engineers from Allen Hall.
  <p>After the recpetion David Kam, Jawed and Matt's Script Archive and I all were weearing 3Dfx
   shirts (everyone besides me wore them during the reception). 
  We (and Stefan) decided to go to the Mall of America (BFM10K) and do "like stuff."  Among those was walking into Ambercrombie and Fitch and making fun of the people who shopped there and the clothes that they sold.  Everyone in the store gave us looks for our obnoxiousness.
