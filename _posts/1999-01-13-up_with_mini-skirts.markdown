title: Up with mini-skirts!
excerpt: |-
  See, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_254000/254236.stm">girls can do neat things with math</a>.  That would be nifty to make your own encryption code.  Especially if it was good.
  <p>Grr... I'm somewhat upset about how much the price has dropped on computers.  Take a look at this.  In the fall Molly got her 350 MHz gee-whiz whizbang computer for almost $2K, right now you can get a similar computer for half the price.  Not from a well reputed brand, but still, it's $1K less.  I could understand if computers much faster than hers exist now, but none do really.  They are up to about 450 for desktops.  Back when she got her computer they were up to 400 as max.  Oh well... next time either of us get a computer we will be better informed.  Of course, I don't intend to upgrade my processor for a while... unless I get a job where I'm working on something that's many time faster than my current computer and I get computer envy, but I doubt it.
  
  <p>I went to see <i>Practical Magic</i>.  It was a cute happy silly movie...  I don't understand who they were aiming at, whether adults or children... I think this is the genre known as chick-flick.  Well the movie taught me everything I need to know about witchcraft.
  <p>
  Hey can somebody find me the MP3 referenced in this <a href="http://www.public-enemy.com/audiovideo/btn.html">letter</a>?  It's called <i>Bring the Noise 2000</i>.  I'm hoping that it will be the long awaited update to their song <i>Bring the Noise</i>.
  
  <p>Okay, I saw some decent comedy from Canada while watching <i>This Hour Has 22 Minutes</i>.  There was a great parody of <i>Ally McBeal</i>.  "[Ally McBeal is] back for another year of putting women in their place."  The parody was far too amusing, I only wish I had made a recording of the clip for Tanya Zoom.  The show had other humorous points.  I'd watch it more often, but hey, I have school.  However, Canadian comedy is much funnier than that MAD TV/SNL crap we've been getting shoved up our armpits for the last few decades.  I mean, who else makes fun of Americans =)
