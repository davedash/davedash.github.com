title: September Cycle
excerpt: I am caught in what I call the September Cycle.  It's when all the first major assignments are due.  I have a speech due next week and a presentation due next week.  Nothing really exciting will happen to me for most of the month, so the updates will be sparse for the next week or so.  I ate at <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/navigation/buildings/far.top.html">FAR</a>'s <a href="http://www.urh.uiuc.edu/dining/srs/Pizza.html">Pizza Parlor</a>.  It took a few hours to get our food and finish it, but it was worth it.  Best meal I've had from this campus.  The Pizza was mediocre, but the salad was nice.
