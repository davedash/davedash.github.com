excerpt: |-
  <a href=http://eoh.cen.uiuc.edu/>EOH</a> is happening tomorrow and Saturday.  Please come.  It's looking really cool.  Right now I'm live at DCL (the UIUC Computer Science building, you could live here) and <a href=http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/>ACM</a> and it's SIGs are setting up shop all over the place.  It's amazing.  Also check out <a href=http://www.ftmax.com/y2k/>my team</a> as we compete in the <a href=http://dc.cen.uiuc.edu/>Jerry Sanders Design Competition</a>.
