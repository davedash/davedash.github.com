title: Email Mistakes
excerpt: People are so dumb.  Mistake 1.  One of the admins at Unit One sent an email to everybody with everyone's name (like everyone from Allen Hall) in to "To" field.  Normally this is to be put in the BCC field so people do not accidentally reply to all <b>and</b> so people do not have to scroll through so many names.  Mistakes 2 and onward were people replying to all.  So my UIUC mailbox was filled with all this crap, just because of Mistake 1.  Grr...  I am getting a gift from Minnesota.  Right now the gift is in Wisconsin.
