[FriendFeed][f] is pure genius.

I had this idea that I was going to write an aggregation service that took your sources from multiple locations and aggregated them into once nice RSS'able feed so your friends could follow your footprints on the web.

[FriendFeed][f] seems to do just that.  I've listed:

* Amazon.com wishlist
* spindrop
* davedash.com
* livejournal
* del.icio.us
* digg
* flickr
* katie's flickr (since I hardly post)
* gTalk
* last.fm
* netflix
* Pandora
* Twitter
* reddit
* pownce
* youtube
* upcoming
* linked in
* yumbo

That's a lot!  I'm prolly on a few more sites than that, but having one central source where I can point people is great.  What'll be better is if they can do a more Facebook newsfeed style system, where you're not pummeled with everything at once, unles you want it, and it learns what info you are interested (e.g. I am interested in Dave's flickr photos, but not so much his Pandora listening habbits).  Of course that's always stage two, I imagine.

[Try it out][f] if you're everywhere on the web.  Here's [my feed](http://friendfeed.com/davedash).
