title: Happy Birthday Katie
excerpt: |
  I didn't mention it in the last entry, but on Monday Katie Romportl turned 19.  For those of you who don't know Katie Romportl was part of my graduating class at Hopkins High School.  Congratulations Katie.<p>
  I finished my speech yesterday.  I feel more free.  Although now I have to do Laundry, read Chemistry, do four hideous problems of math and write a two page paper by tomorrow.  I'll try this one step at a time.  I came up with this idea.  If you have public showers with partitions like at my school, bring a bag of rocks into the shower.  Throw rocks over the partition until you start seeing red on the other side.  I haven't tried it, and I don't think I will.  It sounds a bit evil.<p>I am on the road to fixing my hard disk problem.  It skips a lot less now that I figured out a bit more about drive termination.  I think I'm on the road to having a healthier hard disk.
