title: Coding Style
excerpt: For those of you who normally only listen to my political rants, bear with me.  This is a rant about coding.  Anyway, you never quite realize the importance of coding style until you actually are handed someone elses code.  Programming is not that hard, except for the complex lexicon it uses.  So here's a tip of the day for people who code things.  Name everything, methods, classes, variables in a very descriptive manner.  This will make it easier for yourself if the code happens to grow, and anybody else who might have to look at the code.  Hmm... maybe I can't work as a programmer.
