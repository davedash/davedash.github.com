title: I need to run away...
excerpt: |-
  I've got this need to run away from people for a while.  I think I'm getting out of line.  I also just need a place to go to get things done.  I think I need an office.
  <P>I need an office that's like all hideout and underground and stuff.  Everything would like be hidden in the walls and then with a touch of a button like all these cool panels and screens would appear.
