In short I am quitting my awesome job at Yahoo! working on [Delicious][d] and will be starting somewhere else next month.

[Delicious][d] has been one of my favorite web "properties" for a number of years and has influenced my work long before I started here.  I've really respected my fellow engineers, managers and product team despite all the transitions we've had to bear.  I am really amazed by how much everyone in our current team has changed over the year and a half.

Delicious has had it's ups and downs, both as a team, as part of Yahoo! and even for me personally.  Lucky for me, I stayed motivated the whole way through and I am glad to be leaving the party while its still fun.
