excerpt: |-
  This week has been considerably easier for me.  Nothing too big is happening.  Heather is having her best friend visit her tomorrow.  Some of the showers stay relatively clean.  My softsoap has tiny beads oof Vitamin E that supposedly get absorbed by my skin.  I personally believe that the shower washes them off of me.<p>Caltech started school a few days back.  That also means I have to find a computer for Molly soon.  Speaking of computers, I got an RMA number for my hard drive and I am thinking of shipping it out soon, except... I now can no longer re create the defects that I was experiencing.  In fact my hard drive makes normal hard drive noises.  I have no idea if I should cancel my RMA number or just wait a few weeks.  I think I'll wait until a week from now before I ship.  It turns out that 75% or so of my MP3s will fit on my old drive, so I'm not to worried about shipping this bad boy...  Hopefully tomorrow they will debrief me on how long a replacement will take, etc.  If it doesn't take too long, I may just send it out right away whether or not the problems occur.  If it's like a week or something, I'll try to push my drive over the edge before sending it.<p>
  My brother bought me some shoes the other day, they should be arriving sometime early next week.<p>My life isn't that exciting.  Imagine if I was so silly that I updated this page daily.  You could take this entry and split it up among the days and just read these crappy one or two line things that describe my life.  Suck, no?<p>
  I've decided that tonight I may want to take a walk around the quad around 10:30 at night.  Just to see what it's like walking around on campus.  They recommend not to.  So well... gee I don't know why the hell I'm doing it, but I think I will.  I don't exactly believe our schools outrageous night crime.
