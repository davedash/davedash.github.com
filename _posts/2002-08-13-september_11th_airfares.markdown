title: September 11th Airfares
---
<p>National Airlines, an airline I've never heard of until today, is offering a special <a href="http://svc.travelocity.com/promos/main_promo/0,,TRAVELOCITY%7CPR_AIR2,00.html?HPTRACK=flt_hdline_one">September 11th Airfare</a>.  You can fly anywhere for a $1 that day, one way (first class is $1 more than their standard ticket price).</p><p>Does anybody see the irony?  The hijackers of September 11th 2001 supposedly purchased a large number of one-way tickets on the planes they wanted to commandeer.  Making it easier for them to take over the plane or something.  Now, any bozo with a couple grand can attempt to do the same.</p><p>By the same cynicism, I've never heard of National Airlines.  They might be one of those airlines that consistantly has PR problems.  You know, like that one airline... airTran... formerly something that started with a "v?"  Chances are these airplanes will either not make it off the ground or have to make an unscheduled stop.</p><p>Just kidding National... haha, you can't be nearly as horrible as Northwest.</p>
