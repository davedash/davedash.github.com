title: Deutschland Beyond
excerpt: |-
  A couple funny things I noticed on WB Kids (the afternoon show that I just happened to catch at 6 AM thanks to C-Band).  One is that they advertise for Bandai's Digimon line.  Digimon is Fox's answer to Pokemon to which WB has exclusive rights.  So it is wierd as hell to see its imitation advertising in a commercial.
  <P>This is from the New Batman/Superman Adventures.  I thought the reference to Pinky and the Brain was cute:<Blockquote>
  Bruce: What are you doing tonight?<BR>
  Barbara: The same thing we do every night, Pinky.<BR>
  Bruce: What?<BR>
  Barbara: Nevermind. </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </P><P>
  Today I am bound for Europe with my brother and sister-in-law.  We'll probably make a small detour in Amsterdam to get some weed and hookers and by tomorrow be in Deutschland.  I'll be heading back to MN on the 16th and leaving the following day for Illinois.  It'll be 6 different airports in one and a half weeks (thanks to the inefficiency of Northwest Airlines as people-movers).
