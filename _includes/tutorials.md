I work with a lot of developers both seasoned and new who are new to python.
Here are some tutorials on things that I hope can be helpful:

* [Virtualenv][v] which I believe is a cornerstone of healthy python
  development.
* [pdb: the python debugger][pdb] which is an incredible tool for debugging
  even the toughest of applications.
* [simple exploration of python with iPython][ipython] a brief intro to the
  popular interactive python shell
