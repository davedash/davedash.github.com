I work with a lot of developers both seasoned and green who are new to python.

Here are some foundations that every python developer should have:

* [Virtualenv][v] which I believe is a cornerstone of healthy python
  development.
* [pdb: the python debugger][pdb] which is an incredible tool for debugging
  even the toughest of applications.
* [simple exploration of python with iPython][ipython] a brief intro to the
  popular interactive python shell

[pdb]: /tutorial/pdb-the-python-debugger
[ipython]: /tutorial/ipython

Python also has some rich third-party libraries.  A favorite of mine for
parsing HTML content is PyQuery.
I've [written a tutorial to get you started with PyQuery][pq].
