### On-Call

On-call can be difficult for any team.  Let me help reduce your teams fatigue.

I can help with:

* Setting up rotations that minimize fatigue
* Setting up tools to allow for easy overrides
* Audting historical pages
* Making each page actionable.
* Creating a post-mortem process that chips away at underlying issues.
