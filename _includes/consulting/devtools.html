<h2>Developer Tools</h2>
<p>
  Developer Tools is more than just having the shiniest new tools.
  It's about working together in a way that makes the best use
  of a developer's time.  I won't just find out what the best tool
  for the job is, I'll find out what things are a drag on your
  engineering team.

<p>
  Whether it's slow deploys, or just slow development
  cycles, I can help identify them and prescribe fixes that fit
  for your business and make your customers happy.
